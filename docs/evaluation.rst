Evaluation
====================================

Bib-dedupe is continuously evaluated against other Python libraries (currently the [asreview datatools](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-datatools)) for duplicate removal in bibliographic datasets.
Complementary data from Hair et al. (2021) is added to the overview.
The notebooks are available for the [evaluation](notebooks/evaluation.ipynb), and the datasets are available in the [data](data) section.
A summary of the evaluation is available in the [README.md](notebooks/README.md), aggregated summaries are exported to [current_results.md](output/current_results.md), and detailed results are exported to a [csv file](output/evaluation.csv).
