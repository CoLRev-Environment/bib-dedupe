Evaluation
====================================

Bib-dedupe is continuously evaluated against other Python libraries (currently the `asreview datatools <https://github.com/asreview/asreview-datatools>`_) for duplicate removal in bibliographic datasets.
Complementary data from Hair et al. (2021) is added to the overview.
The notebooks are available for the `evaluation <https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/bib-dedupe/tree/main/notebooks/evaluation.ipynb>`_, and the datasets are available in the `data <data>`_ section.
A summary of the evaluation is available in the `README.md <https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/bib-dedupe/tree/main/notebooks/README.md>`_, aggregated summaries are exported to `current_results.md <https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/bib-dedupe/tree/main/output/current_results.md>`_, and detailed results are exported to a `csv file <https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/bib-dedupe/tree/main/output/evaluation.csv>`_.
