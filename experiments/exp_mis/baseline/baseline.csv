Although the impact of the sharing economy has received considerable attention over the past few years, extant research has not fully documented the impact of the sharing economy on consumers, workers, industry, or society as a whole. In this study, we exploit the geographical and temporal variation in Uber’s entry to examine its impact on the personal bankruptcy rate as well as on other consumer credit default rates. We empirically document the changes in personal bankruptcy filings after Uber’s entry, and show that personal bankruptcy filings under Chapter 7 experience a drop of 0.047 per 1,000 people after Uber enters a county, which translates to a 3.26% reduction in quarterly bankruptcy filings. Uber’s entry also leads to a reduction in Chapter 13 personal bankruptcy filings, but to a smaller degree (0.018 cases per 1,000 people per quarter). We check the validity of our estimates using business bankruptcy filings, which we find are uncorrelated with Uber’s entry.",,

Mechanism Differences Between Face-to-Face and Virtual Channels,"Chen, Liwei and Hsieh, J. J. Po-An and Rai, Arun and Xu, Sean Xin",719--754,"To attain customer satisfaction, service firms invest significant resources to implement customer relationship management (CRM) systems to support internal customer service (CS) employees who provide service to external customers in both face-to-face and virtual channels. How CS employees apply sophisticated CRM systems to interact with customers and how the mechanisms through which their CRM usage affects customer satisfaction vary across service channels and bear important implications. We approach these issues by investigating the concept of infusion use, defined as CS employees’ assessment of the extent to which they use a CRM system to its fullest potential to best support their work in the CRM-enabled service interaction context. Drawing on the IS success framework and expectation confirmation theory, we first formulate a baseline model that explains the direct and indirect mechanisms through which CS employees’ infusion use of CRM systems leads to customers’ expectation confirmation, which in turn affects customers’ satisfaction. We then draw on the lenses of media richness and communication adaptation to theorize why these two mechanisms exert differential influence in face-to-face and virtual channels. We test the hypotheses by collecting multiwave data from CS employees, customers, and firm archives of a Fortune 500 telecom service firm. We find that (1) CS employee infusion use can directly contribute to customer expectation confirmation and indirectly do so through CS employees’ satisfaction with the system (i.e., user satisfaction), and (2) the direct mechanism plays a more critical role in the face-to-face channel, whereas the indirect mechanism is more important in the virtual channel. Our findings inform managers of the avenues through which employees’ infusion use promotes CRM-enabled service success across face-to-face and virtual service channels.",,

Such initiatives profoundly influence both providers’ choices in terms of healthcare effort levels and HIE adoption and patients’ choice of providers. Using a game-theoretical model of a healthcare setup, we examine the role of payment models in aligning providers’ and patients’ incentives for realizing socially optimal (i.e., first-best) choices. We show that the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) payment model does not necessarily induce the first-best solution. The pay-for-performance (P4P) model may induce the first-best solution under some conditions if provider switching by patients during a health episode is socially suboptimal, making provider coordination less of an issue. We identify an episode-based payment (EBP) model that can always induce the first-best solution. The proposed EBP model reduces to the P4P model if the P4P model induces the first-best solution. In other cases, the first-best inducing EBP model is multilateral in the sense that the payment to a provider depends not only on the provider’s own efforts and outcomes but also on those of other providers. Furthermore, the payment in this EBP model is sequence dependent in the sense that payment to a provider is contingent upon whether the patient visits a given provider first or second. We show that the proposed EBP model achieves the lowest healthcare cost, not necessarily at the expense of care quality or provider payment, relative to FFS and P4P. Although our proposed contract is complex, it sets an optimality baseline when evaluating simpler contracts and also characterizes aspects of payment that need to be captured for socially desirable actions. We further show that the value of HIEs depends critically on the payment model as well as on the social desirability of patient switching. Under all three payment models, the HIE value is higher when switching by at least some patients is desirable than when switching by any patient is undesirable. Moreover, the HIE value is highest under the FFS model and lowest under the P4P model. Hence, assessing the value of HIEs in isolation from the underlying payment mechanism and patient-switching behavior may result in under- or overestimation of the HIE value. Therefore, as payment models evolve over time, there is a real need to reevaluate the HIE value and the government subsidies that induce providers to adopt HIEs.",,

In this study, we examine whether and how firms can leverage consumers’ social connections and engage consumers to share promotional incentives. In collaboration with a leading online deal platform, we report a large-scale randomized field experiment to test the effectiveness of different incentive designs (varying in the shareability and scarcity of promotion codes) in driving social sharing senders’ purchases and successful referrals. We find that the different incentive designs have distinct impacts on the purchase and referral outcomes. Specifically, providing senders with one non-shareable promo code significantly increases their own purchase likelihood, compared to the other experimental groups. In contrast, senders who receive one shareable promo code are less likely to purchase themselves yet are more likely to make successful referrals. Surprisingly, the incentive design with two promo codes containing one non-shareable code and one shareable code increases neither the senders’ purchases nor their successful referrals. Managerially, we estimate that although the one non-shareable promo code group derives the highest net revenue for the experimental period, the one shareable promo code group derives the highest customer lifetime value for the firm from the new customers acquired through the successful referrals. We further conducted two online experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk that replicate the field experiment’s findings and explore the underlying mechanisms of the observed relationships. We find that exclusivity perception and social motives triggered by the incentive designs with one promo code mediate their effects on senders’ self-purchases and successful referrals, respectively, and explain the ineffectiveness of two promo codes. Our study contributes to the bodies of literature on IT-enabled social sharing and social promotions, providing implications for firms on how to design promotional incentives that accommodate the dual role of consumers as purchasers and sharers.",,

However, standardization research has yet to provide a dialectic analysis of how tensions and management responses interact recursively over time, and with what effect. In this paper, we apply dialectics to analyze an action research study of a Swedish initiative that developed and diffused a technology standard to facilitate the integration of disparate IT systems in road haulage firms. Drawing on the technology standardization literature and our empirical analysis, we engage in midrange theorizing to capture the recursive dynamics through which standard-setters construct and respond to manifestations of three latent tensions: development versus diffusion activities, private versus public interests, and local versus global solutions. Our resulting dialectic theorizing explicates how standard-setters bring these latent tensions into being; how they construct salient tensions through the oppositional logics of polarization, complementarity, and mutuality; how they manage these tensions through splitting, integrating, and suspension responses; and how consequential functional, architectural, and organizational standardization outcomes produce a new social order in which new tensions emerge. These theoretical insights contribute to both the technology standardization and dialectics literatures.",,

The Dangers of Training and Evaluating AI Tools Based on Experts’ Know-What,"Lebovitz, Sarah and Levina, Natalia and Lifshitz-Assa, Hila",1501--1526,"Organizational decision-makers need to evaluate AI tools in light of increasing claims that such tools out-perform human experts. Yet, measuring the quality of knowledge work is challenging, raising the question of how to evaluate AI performance in such contexts. We investigate this question through a field study of a major U.S. hospital, observing how managers evaluated five different machine-learning (ML) based AI tools. Each tool reported high performance according to standard AI accuracy measures, which were based on ground truth labels provided by qualified experts. Trying these tools out in practice, however, revealed that none of them met expectations. Searching for explanations, managers began confronting the high uncertainty of experts’ know-what knowledge captured in ground truth labels used to train and validate ML models. In practice, experts address this uncertainty by drawing on rich know-how practices, which were not incorporated into these ML-based tools. Discovering the disconnect between AI’s know-what and experts’ know-how enabled managers to better understand the risks and benefits of each tool. This study shows dangers of treating ground truth labels used in ML models objectively when the underlying knowledge is uncertain. We outline implications of our study for developing, training, and evaluating AI for knowledge work.",,

In this study, we integrate prior findings on the augmenting pathways (where IT investment supports innovation) with a new theory explaining the suppressing pathways (where dynamic adjustment costs associated with large IT investment can be detrimental to innovation) to propose an overall inverted U-shaped relationship between IT investment and commercialized innovation performance (CIP). To test our theory, we analyze a unique panel dataset from the largest economy in Europe and discovered a curvilinear relationship between IT investment and CIP for firms across a broad spectrum of industries. Our research presents empirical evidence corroborating the augmenting and suppressing pathways linking IT investment and CIP. Our findings serve as a cautionary signal to executives, discouraging overinvestment in IT.",,

We study the relationship between online engagement and offline sales, utilizing a quasi-experimental setting in which a leading premium automobile brand gradually launched a new interactive website across markets, allowing for a treatment-control comparison. This paper offers evidence of a causal effect of online engagement on offline sales, with the high-engagement website leading to a decline of approximately 12% in car sales. This negative effect is due to substitution between online and offline engagement; users of the high-engagement website exhibited a decreased tendency to seek out personal contact with a car dealer and proceed to offline engagement—a necessary stage in the car purchase funnel. We develop an analytical model of the online-to-offline sales funnel to generalize our findings and highlight the conditions under which online engagement substitutes for offline engagement and potentially decreases offline sales. Taken together, our findings suggest that while online engagement serves as a means for both product information provision and consumer persuasion, it may fall short in achieving the latter goal, as compared to the offline channel. For purely offline products, hands-on engagement is a necessary step toward purchase. Thus, increasing consumers’ online engagement may not be an optimal strategy if it has the potential to halt progression down the sales funnel and reduce offline engagement.",,

WOM contributors write reviews about products/services provided by business venues and WOM consumers read reviews and use them to form attitudes and make purchase decisions. Gamification elements such as points and badges, awarded to WOM contributors for various reasons, and displayed to WOM consumers, have a dual role in WOM context. First, points awarded for user contributions help motivate WOM contributors to increase their participation. Second, badges awarded to users for visiting business venues signal prior experience or competence, and they help determine how WOM consumers perceive WOM contributors and form their judgments based on the reviews. While the first role of gamification (i.e., motivating users) has been widely studied, the impact of WOM presented along with gamification elements on the perceptions and behavior of the target audience, WOM consumers, has not been examined. This is important to businesses that are looking to attract customers. Drawing on social psychology literature, we show that gamification symbols signaling experience that accompany WOM leads to perceptions of positive WOM contributors as more competent. This leads to important changes in behavioral outcomes such as willingness to visit/buy and willingness to recommend the reviewed outlets.",,

These technologies both enable and threaten occupational identity and create two important tensions: they make the persistence of an occupation possible while also potentially rendering it obsolete, and they magnify both the similarity and distinctiveness of occupations with regard to other occupations. Based on the critical case study of an online community dedicated to data science, we investigate longitudinally how data scientists address the two tensions of occupational identity associated with digital technologies and reach transient syntheses in terms of “optimal distinctiveness” and “persistent extinction.” We propose that identity work associated with digital technologies follows a composite life-cycle and dialectical process. We explain that people constantly need to adjust and redefine their occupational identity, i.e., how they define who they are and what they do. We contribute to scholarship on digital technologies and identity work by illuminating how people deal in an ongoing manner with digital technologies that simultaneously enable and threaten their occupational identity.",,

Evidence from a Large-Scale Examination of Bio-Pharma Firms,"Lou, Bowen and Wu, Lynn",1451--1482,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially reduce the complexities and costs in drug discovery. We conceptualize an AI innovation capability that gauges a firm’s ability to develop, manage, and utilize AI resources for innovation. Using patents and job postings to measure AI innovation capability, we find that it can affect a firm’s discovery of new drug-target pairs for preclinical studies. The effect is particularly pronounced for developing new drugs whose mechanism of impact on a disease is known and for drugs at the medium level of chemical novelty. However, AI is less helpful in developing drugs when there is no existing therapy. AI is also less helpful for drugs that are either entirely novel or those that are incremental “follow-on” drugs. Examining AI skills, a key component of AI innovation capability, we find that the main effect of AI innovation capability comes from employees possessing the combination of AI skills and domain expertise in drug discovery as opposed to employees possessing AI skills only. Having the combination is key because developing and improving AI tools is an iterative process requiring synthesizing inputs from both AI and domain experts during both the development and the operational stages of the tool. Taken together, our study sheds light on both the advantages and the limitations of using AI in drug discovery and how to effectively manage AI resources for drug development.",,

We study how organizations can coordinate human learning and ML in order to learn effectively as a whole. Based on a series of agent-based simulations, we find that, first, ML can reduce an organization’s demand for human explorative learning that is aimed at uncovering new ideas; second, adjustments to ML systems made by humans are largely beneficial, but this effect can diminish or even become harmful under certain conditions; and third, reliance on knowledge created by ML systems can facilitate organizational learning in turbulent environments, but this requires significant investments in the initial setup of these systems as well as adequately coordinating them with humans. These insights contribute to rethinking organizational learning in the presence of ML and can aid organizations in reallocating scarce resources to facilitate organizational learning in practice.",,

Merits and Pitfalls of Working with AI,"Fügener, Andreas and Grahl, Jörn and Gupta, Alok and Ketter, Wolfgang",1527--1556,"We analyze how advice from an AI affects complementarities between humans and AI, in particular what humans know that an AI does not know: “unique human knowledge.” In a multi-method study consisting of an analytical model, experimental studies, and a simulation study, our main finding is that human choices converge toward similar responses improving individual accuracy. However, as overall individual accuracy of the group of humans improves, the individual unique human knowledge decreases. Based on this finding, we claim that humans interacting with AI behave like “Borgs,” that is, cyborg creatures with strong individual performance but no human individuality. We argue that the loss of unique human knowledge may lead to several undesirable outcomes in a host of human–AI decision environments. We demonstrate this harmful impact on the “wisdom of crowds.” Simulation results based on our experimental data suggest that groups of humans interacting with AI are far less effective as compared to human groups without AI assistance. We suggest mitigation techniques to create environments that can provide the best of both worlds (e.g., by personalizing AI advice). We show that such interventions perform well individually as well as in wisdom of crowds settings.",,

Leon",563--692,"Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are breakthrough financial technologies that promise to revolutionize the digital economy. Unfortunately, their long-term adoption in the business world is imperiled by a lack of stability that manifests as dramatic swings in transaction fees and severe participant dissatisfaction. To date, there has been little academic effort to study how system participants react to volatility in fee movements. Our study addresses this research gap by conceptualizing the Bitcoin platform as a data space market and studying how market equilibrium forms between users who demand data space while trying to avoid transaction delays, and miners who supply data space while trying to maximize fee revenues. Our empirical analysis based on past bitcoin transactions reveals the existence of a relatively flat downward-sloping demand curve and a much steeper upward-sloping supply curve. Regarding users, the inelastic nature of demand signals the utility of Bitcoin as a niche platform for transactions that are otherwise difficult to conduct. This result challenges the belief that users may easily abandon Bitcoin technology given rising transaction costs. We also find that the use of bitcoins as a trading asset is associated with higher levels of tolerance to fees. Regarding miners, the comparatively elastic nature of supply indicates that higher fees stimulate mining by a larger magnitude than suppressing demand. This finding implies that, ceteris paribus, the Bitcoin system turns to self-regulate transaction fees in an efficient manner. Our work has implications for the management of congestion in blockchain-based systems and more broadly for the stability of cryptocurrency markets.",,

While research on process organization studies theorizes about process and change, and research on process mining rigorously measures and models business processes, there has so far been limited research that measures and theorizes about process dynamics. This gap represents an opportunity for new information systems research. This research note lays the foundation for such an endeavor by demonstrating the use of process mining for diachronic analysis of process dynamics. We detail the definitions, assumptions, and mechanics of an approach that is based on representing processes as weighted, directed graphs. Using this representation, we offer a precise definition of process dynamics that focuses attention on describing and measuring changes in process structure over time. We analyze process structure over two years at four dermatology clinics. Our analysis reveals process changes that were invisible to the medical staff in the clinics. This approach offers empirical insights that are relevant to many theoretical perspectives on process dynamics.",,

It trains a deep learning model to infer a reviewer’s personality traits. This enables analyses to reveal the role of personality traits in review helpfulness among a large population of reviewers. We develop hypotheses on how personality traits are associated with review helpfulness, followed by hypotheses testing that confirms that higher review helpfulness is related to higher openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness and to lower emotional stability. These results suggest the appropriateness of using these five personality traits as inputs for developing a model for predicting future review helpfulness. Based on an ensemble model using supervised classification algorithms, we develop a predictive model and demonstrate its superior performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",,

L. and Hu, Paul Jen-Hwa",903--927,"This paper examines the role of parenting behaviors in influencing children’s Internet addiction and the consequences of children’s Internet addiction on parents’ job outcomes. First, we draw on attachment theory to theorize that five parenting behaviors (i.e., parental control, monitoring, unstructured time, dissuasion, and rationalization) affect children’s Internet addiction and their effects are moderated by the children’s views of parent–child attachment. Second, we draw on research on the work–family interface to theorize that children’s Internet addiction affects parents’ job outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work exhaustion) and the effects are mediated by family-to-work conflict. We tested our hypotheses using an integrated research approach that includes quantitative and qualitative data. We conducted an online survey to collect quantitative responses from 776 parent–child dyads. The results of our model showed that the effects of parenting behaviors on children’s Internet addiction, except for dissuasion, were moderated by the children’s views of parent–child attachment. Also, family-to-work conflict mediated the effects of children’s Internet addiction on parents’ job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work exhaustion. We collected qualitative data via interviews from 50 parents to cross-validate the results from the quantitative study.",,

Within these networks, professional recommendations are used to supplement profiles and add credibility. These recommendations tend to be overly positive, full of superlatives, and lacking in critical statements (referred to as scope of improvement). We draw on the theory of online trust to argue that having scope of improvement and superlatives may affect various dimensions of trust and to show how online trust, in turn, can affect the usefulness of a recommendation and the likelihood of receiving an interview. We contribute to the body of work on online trust both theoretically and empirically. From a theory perspective, we explain why including scope of improvement and superlatives in recommendations on online professional networks may help certain candidates in getting an interview but hurt others. From an empirical perspective, we provide a unique empirical setting that allows us to observe not only the effect of scope of improvement and superlatives, but also validate the theoretically argued underlying process. Furthermore, through discussion with recruiters, we identify then test contextual factors that differentiate recommendations on online professional networks from traditional recommendations. In this study, we use a scenario-based, quasi-experimental survey to test the effects of superlatives and scope of improvement on the usefulness and effectiveness of recommendations. Further, we test the mediating role of trust and how the experience levels of the recommendee affect the sign and strength of these relationships. Our findings indicate that including scope of improvement increases the effectiveness and usefulness of recommendations for candidates at low- and middle levels of experience. For the most experienced candidates, including scope of improvement has a negative effect on effectiveness. Superlatives negatively affect the perceived competence of the recommender and thus should be avoided. This negative effect is reduced when combined with scope of improvement.",,

We developed a more complete picture of IS workers’ perceived distinctiveness, including its composition and outcomes. The perceived distinctiveness of the IS profession, in turn, contributes to individuals’ professional identity. We employed a mixed methods design (qualitative and quantitative) to leverage the strengths of each method. In Study 1, we analyzed transcripts of focus group interviews, using a robust qualitative method—revealed causal mapping. Utilizing the midrange theory that emerged from Study 1, we further explicated and empirically tested it with a quantitative field survey in Study 2. The meta-inference from these relationships can be stated as follows: The occurrence of change within the profession, the facets of knowledge needed, and the continuous refinement and adaptation of the knowledge base within a mentally demanding work context are what make the IS profession distinctive from other professions. Specifically, our findings indicate that the extent of change; the need for continuous learning; the use of creativity and logic to solve problems; the breadth of knowledge, skills, and abilities required; and the level of technology and business integration, time pressure, and stress compose the perceived distinctiveness of the IS professional. Future research might use our findings to incorporate elements of the IS profession into IS-specific theories.",,

To extend the literature on the traditional IT outsourcing literature—a stream that largely focuses on medium-to-large scale offline projects—we investigate how to develop trust and commitment in a triadic microsourcing relationship which includes the microsourcer, the microsourcee, and the microsourcing platform (MP). We draw on transaction cost economics (TCE) to theorize a model specifically adapted to the microsourcing phenomenon to scrutinize the influences of formal contractual mechanisms, relational mechanisms, and third-party mechanisms. Combining data from a matched sample of microsourcers and microsourcees on the leading Chinese MP, Zbj.com, the paper deploys degree-symmetric modeling (DSM) for construct conceptualization, measurement, and data analysis. DSM is consistent with the holistic view used to develop the research model for triadic relationships. Findings confirm that the MP is critical in delivering governance mechanisms to ensure the development of triadic trust and commitment. The results suggest that researchers and practitioners should pay closer attention to triadic trust and commitment building through proper governance mechanisms in the online microsourcing marketplace. We argue that this work could be extended to other online digital platforms that involve multiple transacting parties.",,

Document repositories are intended to enhance the ability to access codified knowledge and help improve task performance through knowledge reuse. However, it is not clear what effects they have on how knowledge workers perform their tasks. Using longitudinal data on repository accesses and calls to technical support by field technicians in an engineering firm, we examine how just-in-time access to codified knowledge affects patterns of help-seeking from technical support. We find evidence that greater accessing of codified knowledge reduces calls for help to technical support. The type of codified knowledge accessed from the repository affects field technicians’ calling behavior. Accessing general knowledge reduces calls to support for low-complexity problems, while accessing procedural knowledge reduces calls related to high-complexity problems. Further, accessing procedural knowledge is significantly associated with promotion, suggesting that the use of document repositories can help individuals build firm-specific human capital. Building on the insights of cognitive load theory, this study suggests that making information available just in time through document repositories reduces the cognitive load involved for task performance and enables learning. This work contributes to a greater understanding of the value of knowledge management systems and suggests that, beyond the efficiencies gained from knowledge reuse, just-in-time access to knowledge repositories builds problem solving capabilities and contributes to human capital development.",,

Automated approaches to achieving fair- ness often fail in complex situations, leading some researchers to suggest that human augmentation of ML tools is necessary. However, our current understanding of human–ML augmentation remains limited. In this paper, we argue that the Information Systems (IS) discipline needs a more sophisticated view of and research into human–ML augmentation. We introduce a typology of augmentation for fairness consisting of four quadrants: reactive oversight, proactive oversight, informed reliance, and supervised reliance. We identify significant intersections with previous IS research and distinct managerial approaches to fairness for each quadrant. Several potential research questions emerge from fundamental differences between ML tools trained on data and traditional IS built with code. IS researchers may discover that the differences of ML tools undermine some of the fundamental assumptions upon which classic IS theories and concepts rest. ML may require massive rethinking of significant portions of the corpus of IS research in light of these differences, representing an exciting frontier for research into human–ML augmentation in the years ahead that IS researchers should embrace.",,

We tested our model using a dataset drawn from 1,454 publicly listed firms in China. Our findings show that the presence of a CIO positively influences AI orientation and that board educational diversity, R&D experience, and AI experience positively moderate the CIO’s effect on AI orientation. Our post hoc analysis further demonstrates that these board characteristics represent contingencies that impact AI orientation but not conventional IT orientation. This paper contributes to the upper echelons literature and IT management research by offering contextualized arguments that explain new business and IT strategies such as AI orientation. Further, our findings suggest important implications about how to build top management teams and boards capable of effectively developing AI orientations",,

Christopher and Hidalgo, Cesar",1025--1058,"During the last four decades, digital technologies have disrupted many industries. Car control systems have gone from mechanical to digital. Telephones have changed from sound boxes to portable computers. But have the firms that digitized their products and services become more valuable than firms that didn’t? Here we introduce the construct of digital proximity, which considers the interdependent activities of firms linked in an economic network. We then explore how the digitization of products and services affects a company’s Tobin’s q—the ratio of market value over assets—a measure of the intangible value of a firm. Our panel regression methods and robustness tests suggest the positive influence of a firm’s digital proximity on its Tobin’s q. This implies that firms able to come closer to the digital sector have increased their intangible value compared to those that have failed to do so. These findings contribute a new way of measuring digitization and its impact on firm performance that is complementary to traditional measures of information technology (IT) intensity.",,

We focus on executives employed by Standard & Poor’s 500 constituent companies from 2010 to 2013 and evaluate their PB on social media by analyzing their Twitter accounts. To disentangle the effect of PB from that of personality traits, we exploit a (positive) shock to the effectiveness of PB caused by a series of technology upgrades by Twitter. Estimations from a two-sided matching model suggest that social media PB benefits executive candidates in job markets. This paper contributes to the literature by initiating the study of the emerging phenomenon of social media PB and testing its effect on job market performance.",,

We suggest that this assumption may not hold for reviews expressing anger. Building on the theory of emotions as social information (EASI), we propose that although expressions of anger in a negative review tend to decrease reader perceptions of review helpfulness, the same expressions tend to increase the negative influence of the review on reader attitudes and decisions. Results from a series of laboratory experiments provide support for our claims. Our findings challenge the widely accepted assumption that more “helpful” reviews are ultimately more persuasive and extend the current understanding of the interpersonal effects of emotion in online communication. Our findings also suggest implications for review platforms, retailers, marketers, and manufacturers faced with the task of managing consumer reviews.",,

Depending on their relative preference for a firm, such “multi-homing” consumers may adopt each firm partially and therefore contribute to the network benefits of no firm fully, as would be the case with single-homing. Consumers’ level of adoption of competing products is a key feature of multi-homing, which, while observed widely in practice, has not previously been studied in the literature. Through a series of analytical models, we demonstrate the important role of this construct in the pricing and capability-related decisions of competing firms. Our results provide several new insights, which suggest that as multi-homing (M) settings become common across industries, technology strategists and managers should exercise caution against simply extrapolating insights from single-homing (S) settings, where consumers adopt only one firm, or from M settings, where the level of adoption is not accounted for. Specifically, in markets where competing products are not well differentiated, contrary to intuition, we find that under price competition, a firm’s profit can be hurt by high levels of adoption by multi-homing consumers; further, in markets where prices are inflexible, a firm with a higher level of adoption can succeed even with a lower level of capability innovation relative to that of an S setting. In contrast to single-homing settings, we show that firms in M settings need to mitigate uncertainty regarding network benefits if the level of adoption is low. Finally, we explore the role of adoption level in two-sided markets and demonstrate that if one side does not have a strong preference for a platform, then, contrary to prevailing wisdom, the latter need not strongly subsidize the other side of the market.",,

The Activity of Daily Living (ADL) approach is a common means to monitor disease progression and the ability of these individuals to care for themselves. However, the prevailing sensor-based ADL monitoring systems primarily rely on wearable motion sensors, capture insufficient information for accurate ADL recognition, and do not provide a comprehensive understanding of ADLs at different granularities. Current healthcare IS and mobile analytics research focuses on studying the system, device, and provided services, and is in need of an end-to-end solution to comprehensively recognize ADLs based on mobile sensor data. This study adopts the design science paradigm and employs advanced deep learning algorithms to develop a novel hierarchical, multiphase ADL recognition framework to model ADLs at different granularities. We propose a novel 2D interaction kernel for convolutional neural networks to leverage interactions between human and object motion sensors. We rigorously evaluate each proposed module and the entire framework against state-of-the-art benchmarks (e.g., support vector machines, DeepConvLSTM, hidden Markov models, and topic-modeling-based ADLR) on two real-life motion sensor datasets that consist of ADLs at varying granularities: Opportunity and INTER. Results and a case study demonstrate that our framework can recognize ADLs at different levels more accurately. We discuss how stakeholders can further benefit from our proposed framework. Beyond demonstrating practical utility, we discuss contributions to the IS knowledge base for future design science-based cybersecurity, healthcare, and mobile analytics applications.",,

These negotiations are manifested in the temporal evolution of the peer-produced artifact. In this study, we conceptualize the evolution of a digital artifact as a trajectory in a feature space. Our theoretical frame suggests that, through negotiations, contributors’ actions “pull” the trajectory and shape its movement in the feature space. We hypothesize that the type of contributors that work on a focal article influences the extent to which that article’s trajectory explores alternative positions within that space, and that the trajectory’s exploration is, in turn, associated with the artifact’s quality. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the trajectories of wiki articles drawn from two peer-production communities, Wikipedia and Wikia, tracking the evolution of 242 paired articles for over a decade during which the articles went through 536,745 revisions. We found that the contributors who are the most likely to increase the trajectory’s exploration are those that (1) return to work on the focal artifact and (2) are unregistered members in the broader online community. Further, our results show that the trajectory’s exploration has a curvilinear association with article quality, indicating that exploration contributes positively to quality, but that the effect is reversed when exploration exceeds a certain level. The insights derived from this study highlight the value of an artifact-centric approach to increasing our understanding of the dynamics underlying peer-production.",,

The transaction data in auction markets are useful for understanding the buyers and sellers in the market. Previous research has shown that sellers with different levels of reputation, as shown by the ratings and comments left in feedback systems, enjoy different levels of price premiums for their transactions. Feedback scores and feedback texts have been shown to correlate with buyers’ level of trust in a seller and the price premium that buyers are willing to pay (Ba and Pavlou 2002; Pavlou and Dimoka 2006). However, existing models do not consider the time-order effect, which means that feedback posted more recently may be considered more important than feedback posted less recently. This paper addresses this shortcoming by (1) testing the existence of the time-order effect, and (2) proposing a Bayesian updating model to represent buyers’ perceived reputation considering the time-order effect and assessing how well it can explain the variation in buyers’ trust and price premiums. In order to validate the time-order effect and evaluate the proposed model, we conducted a user experiment and collected real-life transaction data from the eBay online auction market. Our results confirm the existence of the time-order effect and the proposed model explains the variation in price premiums better than the benchmark models. The contribution of this research is threefold. First, we verify the time-order effect in the feedback mechanism on price premiums in online markets. Second, we propose a model that provides better explanatory power for price premiums in online auction markets than existing models by incorporating the time-order effect. Third, we provide further evidence for trust building via textual feedback in online auction markets. The study advances the understanding of the feedback mechanism in online auction markets.",,

Knowledge about the drivers of these, and specifically the role of information in stimulating such behaviors, is limited. To address this gap, this paper turns to foraging and risk-sensitivity theories. These theories suggest that animals engage in more dangerous behaviors when their perceived need for calories is high. Similarly, humans increase financial risk-taking when they perceive dissatisfaction with what they have. Importantly, inequality information can increase such perceptions and change people’s risk-taking propensity. Adapting these ideas, the paper postulates that TMDBs resemble food-seeking in animals in that they are goal oriented, can be dangerous, and yield unknown (probabilistic) rewards. Therefore, TMDBs are explained using foraging and risk-sensitivity theory angles. Focusing on social media users (Studies 1-4; four experiments; total n = 2,504), I argue that (1) it is reasonable to view users as foraging the “fields of social media” for social-hedonic rewards, (2) it is possible to alter their risk appetite and TMDBs through inequality information and upward comparison mechanisms, (3) this process can be mediated not only through cognitions, but also emotions, and (4) perceived scarcity of rewards and social comparison orientation affect this process. With Study 5, the paper extends the core aspects of this theoretical perspective to the U.S. state level and argues that objective financial inequality can explain differences between states in terms of TMDBs such as texting while driving and relative interest in TMDBs such as prank videos. The findings largely support these assertions. They illuminate the role of information, notably inequality, in driving TMDBs, extend prior research focused on basic needs (e.g., physiological needs in the case of food intake decisions) to an evaluation of higher-order human needs (e.g., needs for belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization) catered to by nonphysiological, social-hedonic rewards, and point to important mechanisms that translate inequality into TMDBs.",,

At the same time, BSIS use can give rise to information overload, making it difficult for firms to leverage the most pertinent information for innovation. Although there has been progress in developing the understanding of the role of IS in innovation, it is unclear what capabilities firms need to develop to facilitate innovation in the presence of information overload from BSIS (IO-BSIS). We maintain that firms are increasingly experiencing IO-BSIS and therefore a thorough investigation of firm-level capabilities to facilitate innovation while coping with IO-BSIS is needed. To address this important gap, we broaden the theory of problemistic search for innovation by proposing a digitally enabled collaborative problemistic search (CPS) capability. We propose that a cross-stream CPS effect—the interaction of CPS with customers (CPS-C) and CPS with suppliers (CPS-S)—can enable firms to reinvigorate their internal knowledge for innovation by engaging customers and suppliers in filtering and interpreting market-facing information. Further, we theorize that the presence or absence of IO-BSIS is a contingency factor that affects whether the cross-stream CPS effect is likely to be beneficial or detrimental to innovation. Based on the analysis of data collected from 227 firms, we find that the cross-stream CPS effect is beneficial for innovation when firms face IO-BSIS and detrimental to innovation when firms do not experience IO-BSIS. We thus open the black box of the digitally enabled innovation activity by shedding light on specific collaborative activities that advance innovation while enabling firms to cope with information overload.",,

Such a claim gives rise to a tension between the need to produce knowledge independent of domain experts and the need to remain relevant to the domain the system serves. This two-year ethnographic study focuses on how developers managed this tension when building an ML system to support the process of hiring job candidates at a large international organization. Despite the initial goal of getting domain experts “out the loop,” we found that developers and experts arrived at a new hybrid practice that relied on a combination of ML and domain expertise. We explain this outcome as resulting from a process of mutual learning in which deep engagement with the technology triggered actors to reflect on how they produced knowledge. These reflections prompted the developers to iterate between excluding domain expertise from the ML system and including it. Contrary to common views that imply an opposition between ML and domain expertise, our study foregrounds their interdependence and as such shows the dialectic nature of developing ML. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for the literature on information technologies and knowledge work, information system development and implementation, and human–ML hybrids.",,

An Economic Analysis of Shared IT Services and Implications for IT,"Chen, Min and Pang, Min-Seok and Kumar, Subodha",225--267,"We are witnessing an interesting and unique phenomenon in enterprise information technology (IT) adoption and management in public-sector organizations: shared IT services. Instead of implementing separate IT services, governments come together to pool their IT resources into one single IT service. In this study, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze the governments’ decision to share IT services and understand how the introduction of shared services transforms the strategic interactions between the governments and the vendor. We study three common regimes used in the adoption of shared IT services: (1) a cost-sharing regime where costs are split proportionally, (2) a profit-center regime where one government charges a surplus-maximization price to the other, and (3) a coordination regime where governments coordinate their decisions to maximize aggregate surplus. Our analyses generate several intriguing findings. First, although charging a surplus-maximizing price seems to be a lucrative option, we find that a government does not always benefit by acting as a profit center. Second, the cost-sharing regime does not always incentivize the shared service adoption despite being often viewed as a fairer and more convenient arrangement. Third, we find that there can be significant under-utilization of shared services in the absence of proper coordination, in a sense that the governments may choose not to share their IT services even if doing so would increase their aggregate surplus. Finally, even though coordination promotes the adoption of shared IT services, it can sometimes be inefficient from the social welfare’s perspective because the increase in governments’ surplus can be outweighed by the decrease in the vendor’s profit. We also present a range of extensions to our model to show that our main takeaways carry over when some model assumptions are relaxed.",,

Location Protection against Machine-Learning Prediction Attacks in Social Networks,"Han, Xiao and Wang, Leye and Fan, Weiguo",821--858,"User privacy protection is a vital issue of concern for online social networks (OSNs). Even though users often intentionally hide their private information in OSNs, since adversaries may conduct prediction attacks to predict hidden information using advanced machine learning techniques, private information that users intend to hide may still be at risk of being exposed. Taking the current city listed on Facebook profiles as a case, we propose a solution that estimates and manages the exposure risk of users’ hidden information. First, we simulate an aggressive prediction attack using advanced state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms by proposing a new current city prediction framework that integrates location indications based on various types of information exposed by users, including demographic attributes, behaviors, and relationships. Second, we study prediction attack results to model patterns of prediction correctness (as correct predictions lead to information exposures) and construct an exposure risk estimator. The proposed exposure risk estimator has the ability not only to notify users of exposure risks related to their hidden current city but can also help users mitigate exposure risks by overhauling and selecting countermeasures. Moreover, our exposure risk estimator can improve the privacy management of OSNs by facilitating empirical studies on the exposure risks of OSN users as a group. Taking the current city as a case, this work offers insight on how to protect other types of private information against machine-learning prediction attacks and reveals several important implications for both practice management and future research.",,

Two mechanisms foster user participation in charitable social movements: content creation and content sharing. Users can create original content to express their attitude of giving and promote their most valued nonprofit organizations, enriching the depth of the conversation. They can also share others’ content to expedite the diffusion of high-quality content, expanding the breadth of the discussion. This paper investigates the impact of reciprocal and nonreciprocal followees (i.e., a followee is an account to which other users subscribe) on followers’ decisions to create and share content. Analyzing the charitable movement of Giving Tuesday on Twitter, we find that original charitable content creation is prompted by reciprocal followees’ participation but not nonreciprocal followees’ participation in this movement. We also find that charitable content sharing is evoked by both reciprocal and nonreciprocal followees, with nonreciprocal followees having a greater impact. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.",,

Research demonstrates, however, that women are often disadvantaged in their access to such networks. Using a randomized field experiment at an IT conference, we found that women had worse networking outcomes than men. Relative to men, women met 42% fewer new contacts, spent 48% less time talking to them, and added 25% fewer LinkedIn connections. We theorize that in fields where women are underrepresented (e.g., IT) two networking barriers—search and social—differentially affect men and women. We designed and experimentally tested interventions for reducing these barriers. The search intervention was designed to facilitate locating diverse contacts and information. The social intervention was designed to facilitate helping behavior and connecting across social boundaries. Our findings indicate that the search intervention increased the number of new contacts women met by 57%, the time they spent talking with them by 90%, the number of LinkedIn connections they added by 29%, and their odds of changing jobs by a factor of 1.6. The social intervention also increased the time women spent talking to new contacts by 66%. However, the interventions did not improve men’s outcomes. Our results show that simple interventions can help women expand their networks and find jobs.",,

Predicting Hotspots in Two-Mode Social Networks,"Li, Zhepeng (Lionel) and Ge, Yong and Bai, Xue",925--966,"In social networks, social foci are physical or virtual entities around which social individuals organize joint activities, for example, places and products (physical form) or opinions and services (virtual form). Forecasting which social foci will diffuse to more social individuals is important for managerial functions such as marketing and public management operations. In terms of diffusive social adoptions, prior studies on user adoptive behavior in social networks have focused on single-item adoption in homogeneous networks. We advance this body of research by modeling scenarios with multi-item adoption and learning the relative propagation of social foci in concurrent social diffusions for online social networking platforms. In particular, we distinguish two types of social nodes in our two-mode social network model: social foci and social actors. Based on social network theories, we identify and operationalize factors that drive social adoption within the two-mode social network. We also capture the interdependencies between social actors and social foci using a bilateral recursive process—specifically, a mutual reinforcement process that converges to an analytical form. Thus, we develop a gradient learning method based on a mutual reinforcement process that targets the optimal parameter configuration for pairwise ranking of social diffusions. Further, we demonstrate analytical properties of the proposed method such as guaranteed convergence and the convergence rate. In the evaluation, we benchmark the proposed method against prevalent methods, and we demonstrate its superior performance using three real-world data sets that cover the adoption of both physical and virtual entities in online social networking platforms.",,

The Divide between Retailer’s and Manufacturers’ Preferences for Reviews and Review Monetization,"Zhang, Haozhao and Zhang, Zhe (James) and Raghunathan, Srinivasan",1349--1410,"Research on online product reviews has examined a variety of issues ranging from reviewers’ motivation to write reviews to the impact of reviews on product sales. Implicit in this research stream is the notion that more reviews are better for sellers and consumers. However, it is unclear whether both retailers, who control the review platform, and manufacturers, whose products are reviewed, prefer more reviews over fewer reviews. Using a game theoretical model of a context in which a dominant retailer sells competing products from two manufacturers to consumers who are uncertain about product quality and fit, we show that the retailers’ and manufacturers’ preferences regarding the number of reviews are not always aligned. The nature of misalignment depends on whether the quality or the fit is more dominant in terms of consumers’ evaluation of products. If generating reviews do not cost anything, we found that additional reviews always benefit the retailer; however, if the number of reviews exceeds a threshold in the quality-dominates-fit case scenario, they may be harmful to the manufacturer. On the other hand, if the retailer incurs a sufficiently high cost to generate reviews, the retailer may prefer to have fewer reviews. We show that retailers can exploit the divide between retailers’ and manufacturers’ preferences for reviews and monetize reviews by charging a fee to the manufacturers in return for a guarantee on the number of reviews that they generate. We show that the product type and review platform design play a significant role in the attractiveness of review monetization for retailers. Even if reviews are monetized, we determined that retailers’ revenue from “selling” reviews to manufacturers does not exceed the cost of generating reviews, implying that the benefit from reviews is driven the positive impacts of reviews on the retailer’s core business of selling products to consumers. However, in the fit-dominates-quality case scenario, retailers do not prefer large numbers of reviews whereas manufacturers do. In this case, we found that retailers are unable to exploit the misalignment between retailers’ and manufacturers’ preferences for reviews through review monetization.",,

J.",961--978,"Does a provider’s technology support strategy influence its buyers’ post-adoption IT service use? We study this question in the context of cloud infrastructure services. The provider offers two levels of support, basic and full. Under basic support, the provider handles simple service quality issues. Under full support, the provider also offers education, training, and personalized guidance through two-way interactions with buyers. Using unique data on public cloud infrastructure services use by 22,179 firms from March 2009 to August 2012, we find that buyers who receive full support use the service 34.85 percent more than other users. We further show that buyers who have full support deploy infrastructure services more efficiently, increasing the fraction of servers they run in parallel by 3.53 percentage points relative to those who do not. Furthermore, buyers who drop full support and switch back to basic support continue using 15.01 percent more of the service and have a proportion of servers running in parallel that is 2.82 percentage points higher compared to buyers who have never received full support. These findings provide suggestive evidence of buyer learning as a result of provider support.",,

The framework is general in nature and can be deployed in any utility-maximizing context, public or private. It relies on randomized field experiments for causal inference, machine learning for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, and on the optimization of an integer linear program for converting predictions into decisions. The net result is the discovery of individual-level targeting of policy interventions to maximize overall utility under a budget constraint. The framework is set in the context of the four pillars of analytics and is especially valuable for companies that already have an existing practice of running A/B tests. The key contribution of this work is to develop and operationalize a framework to exploit both within- and between-treatment arm heterogeneity in the utility response function in order to derive benefits from future (optimized) prescriptions. We demonstrate the value of this framework as compared to benchmark practices—i.e., the use of the average treatment effect, uplift modeling, as well as an extension to contextual bandits—in two different settings. Unlike these standard approaches, our framework is able to recognize, adapt to, and exploit the (potential) presence of different subpopulations that experience varying costs and benefits within a treatment arm while also exhibiting differential costs and benefits across treatment arms. As a result, we find a targeting strategy that produces an order of magnitude improvement in expected total utility for the case where significant within- and between-treatment arm heterogeneity exists.",,

A Synthesis of the Past, Present, and Future","Rezazade Mehrizi, Mohammad H. and Nicolini, Davide and Rodon, Joan",531--590,"We review the literature on how organizations learn from information system (IS) incidents. We identify three modes of learning depending on the practices that constitute the learning process, the specific actors who play roles in learning, the temporal orientation of the learning practices, and the specific contextual focus of the learning. The literature focuses primarily on learning from past experience to draw lessons for future incidents (reflective learning mode). Yet, a growing stream of literature stresses the importance of learning through engagement with present incidents (embedded learning mode), and a few studies suggest that organizations can learn prospectively to prepare for future incidents (prospective learning mode). We argue that although these three learning modes are effective, they do not adequately explain how organizations learn from IS incidents when used in isolation. Since IS incidents unfold increasingly as sets of interacting events across information systems and organizational settings, organizational learning needs to be theorized as an iterative process among these learning modes. We synthesize these three learning modes into an integrative framework and theorize about their supportive and inhibiting relations. We suggest some opportunities for future research, which would advance our understanding of how organizations learn from IS incidents.",,

In contrast to products that exhibit positive network externalities upon adoption, this structure of incentives likely results in negative peer influence: the more friends that adopt the product, the smaller the incentive to adopt. We measure this effect empirically by using observational data from a large mobile carrier serving 5.7 million users. We estimate the effect of peer influence across five different products of this type. A naive approach to do this results in a positive estimate for peer influence due to unobserved homophily. We follow two approaches to address this issue. First, we suggest using the number of friends that end up adopting a product as a proxy for unobserved user-fixed effects. Second, we control for homophily by applying a shuffle test, i.e., we compare the effect of peer influence from the original data with the effect obtained from comparable randomly generated data without peer influence. We obtain negative estimates from both approaches, which adds robustness to our findings. Finally, we show that even for these products, the effect of peer influence associated with the first friends that adopt the product is positive because they still convey useful information that reduces uncertainty. The negative effect of peer influence arises only for subsequent friends that adopt the product. While these friends are unlikely to convey new information about the product, they decrease the economic incentive to adopt, resulting in a negative aggregate effect of peer influence.",,

Our study leverages the conduit brokerage perspective and the findings of a multiple case study to develop a novel framework of algorithmic conduit brokerage for understanding information dissemination by bots and the design choices that may influence their actions. Algorithmic conduit brokerage encompasses two intertwined processes. The first process, algorithmic social alertness, relies on bot activity to curate and reconfigure information. Algorithmic social alertness is significant because it involves action triggers that dictate the kinds of information being searched, discovered, and retrieved by bots. The second process, algorithmic social transmission, relies on bot activity to embellish and distribute the information curated. Algorithmic social transmission is important because it can broaden the reach of information disseminated by bots through increased discoverability and directed targeting. The two algorithmic conduit brokerage processes we offer are unique to bots and distinct from the original conceptualization of conduit brokerage, which is rooted in human activity. First, since bots lack the human ability of sensemaking and are instead fueled by automation and action triggers rather than by emotions, algorithmic conduit brokerage is more invariant and reliable than human conduit brokerage. Second, automation increases the speed and scale of information curation and transfer, making algorithmic conduit brokerage not only more consistent but also faster and more extensive. Third, algorithmic conduit brokerage includes a set of new concepts (e.g., action triggers and rapid scaling) that are specific to bots and therefore not applicable to human conduit brokerage.",,

We examine how new-media advertising affects retail platform openness. We develop a game-theoretic model in which a leading retailer, who has both valuation and awareness advantages, and a third-party seller, who sells an identical product, engage in price competition. We find that the availability of relatively low-cost advertising through new media plays a critical role in influencing the leading retailer to open its platform and to form a partnership with the third-party seller, which is impossible when the cost of advertising is relatively high. Low-cost advertising can increase consumer surplus either directly via the third-party seller’s advertising or indirectly via the partnership on the leading retailer’s platform. We also find that the leading retailer has a greater incentive to open its platform and that the partnership is more likely to be formed when there are network effects, when the leading retailer can control the third-party seller’s exposure on its platform, or when the leading retailer can offer a direct advertising service to the third-party seller. Meanwhile, the constraint on the third-party seller’s advertising budget can reduce the leading retailer’s incentive to open its platform, making a partnership less likely. Our analysis offers important insights into the underlying economic incentives that help explain the emerging open retail platform trend in the era of new-media advertising.",,

In this study, we investigate the effects that prosocial crowdfunding has on traditional microfinance institutions (MFIs). Combining multiple data sources, including data from Kiva.org and the Microfinance Information Exchange Market (MIX Market), we examine how access to crowdfunding influences MFIs’ sustainability and interest rates. We find that after joining Kiva, MFIs’ sustainability improves and interest rates decrease. Further investigation suggests that the changes mainly result from efficiency improvement, rather than increased supply of low-cost funds. We propose that joining an online crowdfunding platform induces greater transparency and crowd monitoring, which motivates and empowers MFIs to improve operations and become more efficient.",,

We conducted a longitudinal field study investigating Target’s data breach in 2013 that affected more than 110 million customers. We examined customers’ expectations toward compensation immediately after the breach was confirmed (survey 1) and their experiences after reparations were made (survey 2). Evidence from polynomial regression and response surface analyses of data collected from 388 affected customers showed that customers’ justice perceptions were influenced by the actual compensation provided as well as the type and extent of compensation an organization could and should have provided (i.e., customers’ compensation expectations). Interestingly, both positive and negative expectation disconfirmation led to less favorable justice perceptions compared to when expectations were met. Justice perceptions were, in turn, associated with key outcomes. We discuss implications for research on data security, information systems, and justice theory.",,

Online users who shared their reviews and ratings about a product (or a seller) become an abstract reference group to a focal user interested in the same product. This study focuses on sponsored search results (SSRs), a type of unsolicited information that matches users’ search queries and receives high evaluations from prior consumers. We investigate the effects of positive social cues on alleviating users’ avoidance responses toward an encountered SSR when searching for a product in a C2C e-commerce context. We synthesize the avoidance literature and identify three forms of SSR avoidance, namely, cognitive, behavioral, and affective avoidance. We apply users’ implicit concerns on SSRs to explain users’ avoidance of an encountered SSR. In addition, we extend social influence theory to online settings where abstract reference groups are posited to trigger social influence. We examine how and under what conditions the three forms of SSR avoidance can be reduced by various positive online social cues (i.e., product- and seller-related). We conduct three laboratory experiments. Results attest to users’ implicit concerns on SSRs and their avoidance of SSRs and reveal different effects of various social cues on reducing the three forms of SSR avoidance. This study uncovers the theoretical mechanisms of social influence on reducing SSR avoidance in online settings. It also offers practical implications for online search service providers to help online users’ decision making in their search process.",,

In addition, recommendation strategies combining social proofs with higher levels of induced awareness due to the prescribed temporal diversity have an even stronger effect on the mobile channel. We also examine the heterogeneity of the demand effect across items, users, and contextual settings, further verifying empirically the aforementioned information and persuasion mechanisms and generating rich insights. We also facilitate the estimation of causal effects in the presence of endogeneity using machine-learning methods.

To answer this question a longitudinal investigation of the nature of change in factors affecting the position of women in the IT profession was undertaken.

The individual differences theory of gender and IT was used to analyze life history interviews conducted at four points in time with a total of 63 women whose stories cover the decades from the 1970s to the 2010s. What resulted is a dynamic extension of this theory through the addition of seven themes that characterize the nature of change in factors affecting women IT professionals. The effect on women of economic changes in Ireland is shown to occur through changes in other factors: environmental (i.e., policy, infrastructural, and cultural), identity (e.g., motherhood) and individual (e.g., family).

IoT devices collect, store, analyze, and act upon a continuous stream of data as a by-product of everyday use. However, IoT devices need unrestricted data access to fully function. As such, they invade users’ virtual and physical space and raise far-reaching privacy challenges that are unlike those examined in other contexts. As advanced IoT devices, connected cars offer a unique setting to review and extend established theory and evidence on privacy and data sharing. Employing a sequential mixed methods design, we conducted an interview study (n=120), a survey study (n=333), and a field experiment (n=324) among car drivers to develop and validate a contextualized model of individuals’ data sharing decisions. Our findings from the three studies highlight the interplay between virtual and physical risks in shaping drivers’ privacy concerns and data sharing decisions—with information privacy and data security emerging as discrete yet closely interrelated concepts. Our findings also highlight the importance of psychological ownership, conceptualized as drivers’ feelings of possession toward their driving data, as an important addition to established privacy calculus models of data sharing. This novel perspective explains why individuals are reluctant to share even low-sensitivity data that do not raise privacy concerns. The psychological ownership perspective has implications for designing incentives for data-enabled services in ways that augment drivers’ self-efficacy and psychological ownership and thereby encourage them to share driving data. These insights help reconcile a fundamental tension among IoT users—how to avail the benefits of data enabled IoT devices while reducing the psychological costs associated with the sharing of personal data.",,

Here, we aim to extend the understanding of why employees engage in such acts. A large body of ISP violation research is based on the tenet that people violate ISPs to obtain personal benefits, as explained by rational choice and expectancy theories. But this assumption has only been weakly tested, using mostly correlational approaches. Our objective is to improve the causal basis for this argument by using a noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technique, which actually modulates brain activity in regions of the brain that process value/gain assessments. Therefore, it can substantially increase the claim of causality—that expected rewards lead to ISP violations. To do so, we build on expectancy theory and neuroscience knowledge to theorize why reducing the excitability of neurons in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L DLPFC) can lower the endorsement of ISP violations. We test this idea in four experiments in which we use a NIBS technique called high-definition direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). Our findings support the assertion that the L DLPFC is likely involved in the expectancy theory of ISP violations, and that endorsing such violations can be experimentally adjusted with NIBS techniques. These findings extend the understanding of cybersecurity behaviors, improve the causal support for the common assumption made by rational choice theory studies that ISP violations are motivated through perceived benefits, point to the need to consider the L DLPFC in research on positively valenced (or attractive) technology-mediated actions, and pave the way for future use of brain stimulation techniques for stronger causality claims in information systems research.",,

We find that platform companies acquire earlier (shortly after founding) when compared with non-platform companies, and they often first acquire competing platform companies from the same market niche. As platform companies mature, they begin to acquire non-platform companies from other market niches. This contrasts with how acquisitions are made by non-platform companies, as shown in our analysis.",,

In this context, users are challenged to maintain EIS compliance behavior by continuously learning new ways of using EIS. Furthermore, it is imperative to businesses that employees of a functional unit maintain EIS compliance behavior collectively, due to the interdependent nature of tasks that the unit needs to accomplish through EIS. However, it is particularly challenging to achieve such a collective level of EIS compliance, due to the difficulty that these employees may encounter in quickly learning updated EIS. It is, therefore, vital for firms to establish effective managerial principles to ensure collective EIS compliance of a functional unit in a dynamic environment. To address this challenge, this study develops a research model to explain collective EIS compliance by integrating theoretical lens on social context and performance management context with social capital theory. It proposes that social context, an organizational environment characterized by trust and support, positively affects collective EIS compliance by developing business–IT social capital that enhances mutual learning between business and IT personnel. Furthermore, the performance management context, an organizational environment characterized by discipline and “stretch,” is seen to have a direct and beneficial effect on collective EIS compliance as well as an indirect, moderating effect on the causal chain among social contexts, business–IT social capital, and collective EIS compliance. General empirical support for this research model is provided via a multiple-sourced survey of managers and employees of 159 functional units of 53 firms that use EIS, as well as their corresponding IT unit managers. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",,

Choice overload, a compelling paradox in consumer psychology, exemplifies this notion with the idea that offering more product options could impede rather than improve consumer satisfaction, even when consumers are free to ignore any available option. After attracting intense interest in the past decades from multiple disciplines, research on choice overload has produced voluminous yet paradoxical findings that are widely perceived as inconsistent even at the meta-analytic level. This paper launches an interdisciplinary inquiry to resolve the inconsistencies on both the conceptual and empirical fronts. Specifically, we identified a surprising butrobust pattern among the existing empirical evidence for the choiceoverload effect and demonstrated through mathematical analysis and extensive simulation studies that the pattern would only likely emerge from one specific type of latent mechanism underlying the moderated choiceoverload effect. The paper discusses the research and practical implications of our findings—namely, the broad promise of analytical meta-analysis (an emerging area for the use of data analytics) and machine learning to address the widely recognized inconsistencies in social and behavioral sciences, and the unique and salient role of the information systems community in developing this new era of meta-analysis.",,

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the short-term wage elasticity of labor supply in real-time ridesharing markets using data from a major ridesharing platform in China. By exploiting an exogenous shock from uneven driving restrictions as an instrumental variable, we find a negative labor supply elasticity for ridesharing drivers, suggesting that drivers tend to drive less during days with a higher average hourly wage. Specifically, a percent increase in hourly wage will lead to a 0.931 percent decrease in daily working hours. This surprising finding is consistent with the behavioral income-targeting model based on the theory of reference-dependent preferences: Drivers have heuristic daily targets for total earnings and are more motivated to supply labor when they are below their income target than when they are above it. Therefore, they work less on days when earnings per hour are high and quit the market once their income target is reached. In addition, we find that taxi drivers are more rational and have positive labor supply elasticity, which implies that drivers are more rational when they have repeated opportunities for learning. Estimating labor supply elasticity is critical to understanding the economic efficiency of various surge pricing algorithms and driver subsidization programs for ridesharing platforms and policymakers. Our research suggests that a uniform price surging or driver subsidization approach for all ridesharing drivers may not incentivize the labor supply of drivers effectively.",,

How cross-domain knowledge affects ISD outcomes is one of the most fundamental and persistent problems in the IS field. We argue that the effect of cross-domain knowledge depends on its distribution across business and IT units and ISD complexity in terms of level and pattern of design element interdependencies. We systematically investigate the complex effects of cross-domain knowledge on ISD performance by using simulations based on the NK fitness landscapes model. We find that cross-domain knowledge not only increases ISD performance but also reduces its variability. These effects are greater when ISD complexity is greater. Crossdomain knowledge is found to increase the robustness of ISD performance across different patterns of design element interdependencies. Interestingly, ISD performance is higher when cross-domain knowledge is unevenly distributed across business and IS units and when its distribution pattern matches the pattern of the design element interdependencies. These findings suggest that the effect of cross-domain knowledge on ISD performance is not fixed but depends on its structural pattern, the level and pattern of design element interdependencies, and their interactions. This study illuminates how and why challenges in ISD might be structural and how, why, and when cross-domain knowledge might help to overcome these challenges. We develop a theoretical framework and propositions based on our findings.",,

In particular, we examine the role of risk-taking incentives provided to CEOs, captured by the sensitivity of CEO wealth to stock return volatility (i.e., Vega). Vega can motivate CEOs to engage in risky IT innovation projects by aligning their wealth with firm-specific risk. In so doing, we focus on how CEOs’ IT-related human capital (i.e., IT education and IT experience) moderates the relationship between Vega and IT innovation. Our empirical analyses reveal that a higher Vega encourages CEOs to support more IT innovation; more importantly, the impact of Vega on the amount of IT patents is stronger for firms with CEOs who have higher levels of IT education and IT experience.

Using a qualitative study of Uber drivers’ perceptions, supplemented by interviews with Uber executives and engineers, we present a grounded theory that captures the algorithmic management of work on OLPs.

In this paper, we examine mobile health (mHealth) platforms and their health and economic impacts on the outcomes of chronic disease patients. To do so, we partnered with a major mHealth firm that provides one of the largest mobile health app platforms in Asia specializing in diabetes care. We designed and implemented a randomized field experiment based on detailed patient health activities (e.g., steps, exercises, sleep, food intake) and blood glucose values from 1,070 diabetes patients over several months. Our main findings show that the adoption of the mHealth app leads to an improvement in health behavior, which in turn leads to both short term metrics (such as reduction in patients’ blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels) and longer-term metrics (such as hospital visits and medical expenses). Patients who adopted the mHealth app undertook higher levels of exercise, consumed healthier food with lower calories, walked more steps and slept for longer times on a daily basis. They also were more likely to substitute offline visits with telehealth. A comparison of mobile versus PC-enabled versions of the same app demonstrates that the mobile version has a stronger effect than PC version in helping patients make these behavioral modifications with respect to diet, exercise, and lifestyle, which ultimately leads to an improvement in their healthcare outcomes. We also compared outcomes when the platform facilitates personalized health reminders to patients vis-à-vis generic (non-personalized) reminders. Surprisingly, we found that personalized mobile messages with patient-specific guidance can have an inadvertent (smaller) effect on patient app engagement and lifestyle changes, leading to a lower health improvement. However, they are more like to encourage a substitution of offline visits by telehealth. Overall, our findings indicate the massive potential of mHealth technologies and platform design in achieving better healthcare outcomes.",,

We perform fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of data collected from 248 IT professionals to draw conclusions about the intention among IT professionals to return to work for a former employer, and develop a midrange theory. Our results reveal two configurations contributing to high turnback intention and three configurations contributing to low turnback intention. Our model distinguishes between work shocks, personal shocks, and IT work shocks. IT shocks are a new category of shocks specific to the IT profession. We contribute theoretically by theorizing a behavior relevant to IT professionals and explaining attributes driving turnback intention.",,

I define these concepts precisely, disentangle conceptual from measurement issues, and point to ways that discourse about them could better proceed. I show that unidimensional constructs, multidimensional constructs, dimensions, and indicators are all properties in general of a class of things. I also show that only three types of indicators exist—synonyms of the focal construct and succeeding or preceding properties in a pre-order of properties that includes the focal construct. I examine ontologically the notions of content validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and internal-consistency reliability and show their problematic nature. I introduce two new concepts, scope validity and the level of concomitance of indicators, that have rigorous ontological foundations.

So far, there is no theoretical explanation of why the anti-corruption potential of IT demonstrated in some countries is not realized in many other countries. Drawing evidence from a case study of information systems interventions at Ghana customs over 35 years, we investigate how and why IT’s anti-corruption potential may be curtailed in the context of developing countries’ governments and societies. We focus on IT-mediated petty corruption practices of street-level officers, which we consider to be socially embedded and institutionally conditioned phenomena. We find that conditions of possibility for the IT-mediated petty corruption practices are created during the implementation of information systems. The configuration of IT and organizational processes of a government agency are constrained by the broader government administration system and influenced by the vested interests of government officers, politicians, and businesses. Subsequently, the co-optation of IT for petty corruption practices is enabled by networks of relationships and institutions of patronage that extend across government, business, and society. We thus explain the often limited effects of IT on petty corruption as the inability of localized information systems implementations to change modes of government administration that are embedded in the enduring neopatrimonial institutions and politics of many developing countries.",,

These concurrent tasks compete for the attention of the same pool of solvers. There is some evidence that an increase in the number of competing tasks can reduce the number of solvers participating in a focal task. However, it is not clear exactly how competing tasks influence the quality of tasks, as represented by the best solutions they receive. Using data collected from a popular crowdsourcing platform, we investigate the effects of competing tasks and uncover important underlying mechanisms governing the relationship between competing tasks and task quality. Through analyses at the task, solver, and submission levels, we establish that competing tasks can influence task quality in two ways. First, the number of solvers in each task decreases when there are more competing tasks, and this reduction negatively impacts task quality. Second, the availability of a greater number of competing tasks leads to solvers participating in more tasks simultaneously. This multitasking in turn allows solvers to learn from other tasks, generate better solutions, and improve task quality. Interestingly, we find that these opposing forces offset each other, and that the overall solution quality of the focal task is not affected, despite the fact that an increase in the number of competing tasks reduces the number of solvers participating it.",,

These ratings commonly take the form of either non-personalized, aggregate product ratings (i.e., the average rating a product received from a number of consumers such as “the average rating is 4.5/5 based on 100 reviews”), or personalized predicted preference ratings for a product (i.e., recommender-system-generated predictions for a consumer’s rating of a product such as “we think you’d rate this product 4.5/5”). Ratings in either format can provide decision aid to the consumer, but the two formats convey different types of product quality information and operate with different psychological mechanisms. Prior research has indicated that each recommendation type can significantly affect consumer’s post-experience preference ratings, constituting a judgmental bias, but has not compared the effects of these two common product-rating formats. Using a laboratory experiment, we show that aggregate ratings and personalized recommendations create similar biases on post-experience preference ratings when shown separately. Shown together, there is no cumulative increase in the effect. Instead, personalized recommendations tend to dominate. Our findings can help retailers determine how to use these different types of product ratings to most effectively serve their customers.

Our analysis gives insight into how role conflicts arising from the various roles played by the platform users compromise the nature of actions associated with platform beliefs. In particular, cooptition conflict arising from participants’ roles as supplier to the platform owner and competitor to other platform participants explains the symbolic organizational content contribution, whereas the professional conflict resulting from participants’ roles as employee of an organization and knowledge peer to participants from other organizations explains the substantive personal content contribution. The lack of organizational substantive content creates content paucity, which platform users respond to by developing off-platform relationships with content contributors. The personal ES knowledge acquired through platform content consumption and the relationships with content contributors help individuals advocate for ES initiatives within their organizations. Our research is among the first to consider green IS at an interorganizational level and the corresponding multilevel perspective of the green IS users as they are at once organizational and individual actors.",,

Mobile apps have been developed for social networking, banking, receiving daily news, maintaining fitness, and job-related tasks. The security of apps is an important concern. However, in some cases, app developers may be less interested in investing in the security of apps, if users are unwilling to pay for the added security. In this paper, we empirically examine whether consumers are less willing to pay for security features than for usability features. In addition, we examine whether a third-party certification of security features makes customers more willing to pay for security. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of risk perceptions on the willingness to pay for security. To explore these issues, we conducted a scenario-based experiment on mobile app users. Results from our analyses show that consumers are indeed less likely to pay for security features than usability features. However, the likelihood of paying for security features can be significantly increased by third-party certification of the features. Based on our analysis, we offer insights to producers of mobile apps to monetize the enhanced security features of their apps.",,

Following this lens, we suggest an extended model of sustained social influence (that considers retweets as the measure of user influence) as a function of the duality of individual Twitter users’ social actions and the underlying facilitating Twitter network structure. Based on an analysis of organic large-scale Twitter data on this social movement, we examine how characteristics of individuals’ social actions, namely activity and tenure on Twitter, and characteristics facilitated by the network (i.e., the number of followers as well as centrality in the community structure of Twitter), impact retweet influence in time windows spanning the movement. Utilizing a mixed methods approach consisting of machine learning and human coding we conceptualize social movement-related engagement activities of Twitter users, which map to generic frames of social movement mobilization. The analysis reveals interesting patterns across different contexts of the Egyptian Revolution. Regarding individual social action, social movement related to “who” and “where” activities, as well as tenure, were found to contribute to individual social influence. In terms of the facilitating structure, the follower network (an observed network structure) and centrality (an unobserved network structure) were both found to contribute significantly to sustained influence.",,

Building on the equifinality framework proposed in organizational studies, we posit that an organizational policy that provides higher levels of autonomy for software teams engenders performance-enhancing adaptations through agile reconfigurations of project operations. To test our hypothesis, we collaborated with a commercial software firm and collected data from a policy experiment at the firm. We examined project-level data spanning a four-year observation period during which the firm implemented a new policy that significantly reduced the hurdles for project teams to autonomously reconfigure their operations.

While most existing methods for financial risk prediction are based on a single information source, which may not adequately capture various complex factors that jointly influence financial risks, we propose a hybrid-strategy-based self-adaptive method to effectively leverage heterogeneous soft information drawn from a variety of sources. The method uses a proposed new feature- sparsity learning method to adaptively integrate multisource heterogeneous soft features with hard features and a proposed improved evidential reasoning rule to adaptively aggregate base classifier predictions, thereby alleviating both the declarative bias and the procedural bias of the learning process. Evaluation in two cases at the individual level (concerning borrowers at a P2P lending platform) and the company level (concerning listed companies in the Chinese stock market) showed that, compared with relying solely on hard features, effectively incorporating multisource heterogeneous soft features using our proposed method enabled earlier prediction of financial risks with desirable performance.",,

This paper examines the congestion problem in sequential Dutch auction markets. Transactions in these markets typically involve perishable goods, making market clearing speed crucial. Traditionally, sequential Dutch auctions have been implemented with fast-paced auction clocks that process equally attractive bids in the order they arrive and only award the first bidder as the winner of each round, which can lead to serious congestion in case of a demand surge. We propose a hybrid mechanism that capitalizes on the discrete nature of the auction clock and batches together the highest bids, allowing multiple transactions at the same price in each round. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid mechanism, we first develop a game-theoretic model comparing the hybrid mechanism to the traditional sequential Dutch auction mechanism. Our model predicts that the hybrid mechanism will achieve higher operational efficiency without compromising allocative efficiency. We then complement the theoretical analysis by evaluating the hybrid mechanism through a quasi-natural field experiment. The empirical analysis of the field data shows that the hybrid mechanism can significantly speed up the market clearing process and increase price stability without affecting the expected revenue. Our findings shed new light on the design and operation of multi-unit auctions.",,

Although reciprocity is a fundamental aspect of human psychology, its application in promoting healthy behavior has been limited. We conduct a randomized field experiment with over 1,700 pairs of users on a mobile social network platform. Individuals in the reciprocity treatment group receive a gift from their friends and are asked to return this favor by participating in a running challenge. Their performance is compared to the self-interest incentives widely used in practice. Building on social exchange theory, we argue that reciprocity-based incentives will outperform self-interest incentives with modest reward for motivating behavior change. We find that, on average, reciprocity is stronger than self-interest in inducing exercise behavior by a substantial amount. Furthermore, our results reveal that the magnitude of the reciprocity effect is contingent on the social closeness between senders and receivers. Interestingly, social closeness has an inverted U-shaped influence on the reciprocity effect. The effect is strongest when closeness is moderate, and wanes when closeness is either too strong or too weak. Compared to commonly used self-interest based financial incentives, our findings offer a potentially more powerful avenue for mechanism design in promoting healthy behavior.",,

Since the explanation for these lower performance levels remains unclear, managers are not sure how to help older users realize their full potential as contributors to organizational success. The research model presented here identifies the declining information-processing speed of older workers as the cause of their reduced capacity to perform IT-enabled tasks. According to the model, IT experience and IT self-efficacy reduce the negative impacts of this decline, whereas IT overload and the effort cost of IT use aggravate them. To test the model, data were collected using three complementary studies. The results supported the model and indicated five ways that organizations can help older users improve their capacity to perform IT-enabled tasks.

Peer-oriented online interactions have critical implications for an individual’s virtual presence and self-cognition. Yet existing conceptualizations of internet privacy concerns have solely focused on the control of personal information release and on online interactions with online vendors. Drawing on the theory of personal boundaries, this study revisits the theoretical foundation of online privacy and proposes a multidimensional peer-related privacy concern construct, that focuses on privacy violations from online peers. We term this new construct “Peer Privacy Concern” (PrPC) and define it as the general feeling of being unable to maintain functional personal boundaries in online activities as a result of the behavior of online peers. This construct consists of four dimensions comprised of a reconceptualization of information privacy concerns to also reflect privacy concerns with respect to peers’ handling of self-shared information and with respect to peer-shared information about one’s self, and three new dimensions that tap into the arising privacy needs from virtual interactions (i.e., virtual territory privacy concern and communication privacy concern) as well as from the need to maintain psychological independence (i.e., psychological privacy concern). These new dimensions, which are rooted in the theory of personal boundaries, are prominent privacy needs in online social interactions with peers. However, they are absent from previous privacy concern conceptualizations. Scales for measuring this new construct are developed and empirically validated.",,

The key argument is that since ES can reduce agency costs associated with internal coordination and the transaction cost of coordinating with external partners, ES may be related to the likelihood of M&A. Using a sample of 3,289 firms headquartered in North America from 2010 to 2018 that made 8,373 M&A deals, the empirical analysis suggests that ES are positively related to horizontal acquisitions and negatively related to conglomerate acquisitions. However, as internal coordination costs increase, ES are becoming associated with more conglomerate M&A, especially when the goal is to introduce new products and enter new markets. Also, in contexts where partners require transaction specific investments, ES are associated with a relative decrease in the number of horizontal and vertical M&A. These findings suggest that ES create options for managers to engage in ownership as well as information-based coordination, depending on the internal and external coordination costs as well as the goals of the organization.",,

External investors are further constrained by their lack of visibility into the firm’s intangible, complementary actions and capabilities, creating an information asymmetry between them and the firm’s executives. Building on signaling theory and the research on senior executives’ trades in a firm’s stock, this paper addresses the following question: How are the stock trades by a firm’s senior executives before a major IT investment by the firm associated with the future value to the firm from that IT investment? The results based on data on 2,898 publicly announced IT investments from 926 firms during 2002–2016 suggest that (1) the purchasing of a firm’s stock by its senior executives before a firm’s IT investment is associated with the investment’s longterm effect on firm value; (2) such stock purchases by a firm’s senior executives are associated with a stronger positive (negative) relationship between the IT’s newness and the long-term abnormal returns to firms emphasizing a revenue enhancement (cost reduction) IT strategy; (3) for firms pursuing a hybrid strategy, purchases by CIOs but not purchases by CEOs or the newness of IT are associated with firm value, and (4) purchases made by CIOs provide greater information about the IT investment’s impact on firm value than purchases made by CEOs.

Drawing upon the state of the art in cross-lingual knowledge transfer, ADREL is a novel approach to automatically extract transferable text representations and facilitate the analysis of multilingual content. We evaluate CLHAD on Russian, French, and Italian dark web platforms and demonstrate its practical utility in hacker asset profiling, and conduct a proof-of-concept case study. Our analysis suggests that cybersecurity managers may benefit more from focusing on Russian to identify sophisticated hacking assets. In contrast, financial hacker assets are scattered among several dominant dark web languages. Managerial insights for security managers are discussed at operational and strategic levels.",,

Our longitudinal analysis of the Hadoop software ecosystem indicates that participants covering a broader scope of the platform’s technological layers are less likely to develop new products but more likely to update existing products. In turn, participants with more frequent new product development are more likely to expand their product scope, whereas those with more frequent existing product updates are less likely to pursue scope expansion. Participants’ centrality in the ecosystem’s collaborative network amplifies the bidirectional link between product scope and existing product updates but weakens the link between product scope and new product development.

We find that statistical analyses of observable network structure do not consistently take these discrepancies into account, and this omission may lead to inaccurate inferences about hypothesized network mechanisms. To remedy this issue, we apply techniques of robust optimization to statistical models for social network analysis. Using robust maximum likelihood, we derive an estimation technique that immunizes inference to errors such as false positives and false negatives, without knowing a priori the source or realized magnitude of the error.

This platform provides a realistic and controlled environment in which to study users’ behaviors and perceptions during their first encounter with a website. We show that the presence of social cues on a website (e.g., an environment in which users “like” or rate website content) indirectly affects users’ likelihood of disclosing private information to that website (such as full name, address, and birthdate) by enhancing users’ “social perceptions” of the website (i.e., their perceptions that the website is a place where they can socialize with others). We further show that the presence of social cues is more likely to enhance users’ social perceptions when users are primed to perceive the website as trustworthy, as opposed to untrustworthy (through the presentation of trust cues such as data protection disclaimers). Moreover, we rule out users’ privacy concerns as an alternative mechanism influencing the relationship between social cues and information disclosure.

One promising data source that can help develop proactive CTI is the vast and ever-evolving Dark Web. In this study, we adopted the computational design science paradigm to design a novel deep learning (DL)- based exploit-vulnerability attention deep structured semantic model (EVA-DSSM) that includes bidirectional processing and attention mechanisms to automatically link exploits from the Dark Web to vulnerabilities. We also devised a novel device vulnerability severity metric (DVSM) that incorporates the exploit post date and vulnerability severity to help cybersecurity professionals with their device prioritization and risk management efforts. We rigorously evaluated the EVA-DSSM against state-of-theart non-DL and DL-based methods for short text matching on 52,590 exploit-vulnerability linkages across four testbeds: web application, remote, local, and denial of service. Results of these evaluations indicate that the proposed EVA-DSSM achieves precision at 1 scores 20% - 41% higher than non-DL approaches and 4% - 10% higher than DL-based approaches. We demonstrated the EVA-DSSM’s and DVSM’s practical utility with two CTI case studies: openly accessible systems in the top eight U.S. hospitals and over 20,000 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems worldwide. A complementary user evaluation of the case study results indicated that 45 cybersecurity professionals found the EVADSSM and DVSM results more useful for exploit-vulnerability linking and risk prioritization activities than those produced by prevailing approaches.

Yet they are largely underexplored in current false news detection research, especially in terms of how to efficiently utilize such information. We observe that the crowd contributes to the challenging task of assessing the veracity of news by posting responses or reporting. We propose combining these two types of scalable crowd judgments with machine intelligence to tackle the false news crisis. Specifically, we design a novel framework called CAND, which first extracts relevant human and machine judgments from data sources including news features and scalable crowd intelligence. The extracted information is then aggregated by an unsupervised Bayesian aggregation model. Evaluation based on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of crowd intelligence and the superior performance of the proposed framework in comparison with the benchmark methods.

Using data on over 380,000 patent grants for innovations filed by 730 public IT hardware firms over the time period 1996-2015, we find that greater levels of software-based innovation within the firm are associated with higher levels of product differentiation in product markets: increases in the intensity of software patents within the firm’s patent stock, which we refer to as software intensity, are associated with lower total similarity of product offerings, relative to those offered by rivals, as well as fewer effective competitors in the market. Furthermore, using a different dataset consisting of 23,000 new IT hardware product announcements, we show that firms with greater software intensity subsequently launch a higher number of new products.

Raghav",881--910,"This paper investigates the shared emotional responses of Twitter users in the aftermath of a massive data breach, a crisis event known as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data breach of 2015. This breach impacted the lives of several million individuals due to the exposure of sensitive and personally identifying information. We take a data exploration approach to analyzing over 18,000 tweet messages of the ensuing discussion that took place after public notification that the breach had occurred. The resulting analysis reveals that although the emotions of anxiety, anger, and sadness may initially appear erratic, at an aggregate level, the public display of these emotions corresponds to the situational awareness of the breach event. Further, our analysis finds that this relationship extends to the sharing of emotions, indicating that those participating in the conversation congregate around a sense of shared emotional experience. Finally, an in-depth analysis of the ensuing dialogue identifies the most salient conversational drivers of these emotions, revealing breach concepts most significantly related to each emotion. Based on the results, we present propositions that draw from this analysis to inform emotional response characteristics that emerge over the duration of such crisis events. The results of this study can inform organizational practices and policy making in the context of response to crisis events such as data breaches.",,

Given the ease with which they can be leveraged as implementation interventions or design features on online sites, herding cues hold the promise to provide a means to influence adoption behaviors. Yet, little attention has been devoted in the IS adoption literature to understanding the effects of herding cues. Given that herding cues are just one of several forms of social influence on adoption behaviors and are relatively lean in nature, understanding their viability as an implementation intervention necessitates understanding their effects in the presence of (1) other forms of social influence, which also serve to reduce uncertainty and signal the appropriateness of technology adoption, and (2) an individual’s own beliefs about adopting. In this vein, we conducted a randomized field experiment to examine the use of a herding cue as an implementation intervention to hasten adoption behaviors. The research model was evaluated using survival analysis by combining the data from the field experiment with two waves of surveys, and archival logs of adoption. Our results show that a herding cue (1) directly impacts the time it takes an individual to adopt a technology, (2) amplifies the effects of peer behaviors (another type of informative social influence), but has no impact on the effect of subjective norm (a form of normative social influence), and (3) dampens the effects of an individual’s private beliefs about the usefulness of a technology. Our paper disentangles herding information signals to define a herding cue as distinct from other herd behavior triggers, explores how it may interact with other forms of social influences and private beliefs to influence adoption behaviors, and, on a practical level, provides evidence of how a herding cue can be a tangible intervention to accelerate technology adoption.",,

In this research, we investigate the effect of market information, generated in online auction markets, on buyers’ expectations and choices. To clear large inventories, sellers often conduct many auctions selling identical items over time, which creates an online auction market where competition dynamics spill over from one to auction to another. In these markets, bidders can participate in many auctions over a period of time, observe market information (supply, demand, and competition), and gain experience to increase their payoffs. We observe that despite having an opportunity to compete and win in future auctions, many bidders stop participating in these auction markets. We argue that observed market information affects their choices. We explore how bidders form expectations about market supply, demand, and competition based on information from two sources—market design parameters and behavior of market participants. By employing a hierarchical Bayesian latent attrition model, we empirically detect and investigate the effect of bidders’ expected market supply, demand, and competition on their attrition in these markets. Our study shows that the effect of market information on attrition is nuanced by bidders’ value heterogeneity. Through the lenses of behavioral economics theories, we show that the attrition behavior of high-value bidders is completely opposite that of low-value bidders. We discuss the practical implications of our findings.",,

How Seller Reputation Affects the Role of Product Reviews","Wang, Hongpeng and Du, Rong and Shen, Wenqi and Qiu, Liangfei and Fan, Weiguo",1243--1272,"The sales effect of product reviews has been a contentious issue with competing perspectives about when product reviews serve as a benefit, a burden, or a trifle. Unlike previous research that separately investigates the impact of each eWOM system, our study empirically examines the interaction effects of dual eWOM systems, i.e., product reviews and seller reputation. Drawing on reference point theory, we find that seller reputation systems play a reference-point role and determine the efficacy of product reviews. Specifically, negative reviews cause a significant loss in sales for high-reputation sellers but are less detrimental for low-reputation sellers. In contrast, positive reviews can boost sales for low-reputation sellers but are less helpful for high-reputation sellers. These results highlight that seller reputation is a double-edged sword. While a high seller reputation can reduce seller uncertainty and attract more consumers, it may also raise consumers’ expectations and lead to potential negative expectancy violations. Moreover, we explore what strategies may help mitigate the potentially detrimental effect of reference points for high-reputation sellers. Through the lens of restructuring reference points, the reputation reference effect can be adjusted in a more dynamic reputation system (e.g., a reputation badge). Compared to sellers that have never lost their top-rated badge, sellers that have lost their top-rated badge may face an attenuated detrimental impact on sales from the negative expectancy violation due to negative reviews and enjoy a positive impact from positive reviews. We discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice.",,

Failure to do so may result in a digital product innovation that is too conventional or difficult to relate to or understand. Yet, the extant digital product innovation literature pays little, if any, attention to product meaning. To fill this void, this study examines a digital product innovation project in which product designers created a digital theater with product meanings beyond those of the traditional movie theater. Our theory, grounded in in-depth data collection and analysis, explains how product designers attribute meanings to their products in the process of digital innovation by enacting two meaning-making loops: a reinforcing loop that makes the product meaning comprehensible, and a differentiating loop that captures emerging product meanings. The two loops come together via meaning sedimentation, through which a new core product meaning is created. Our study contributes to the digital product innovation literature by shedding light on the essential role of meaning-making in innovation and offers an explanatory process theory.",,

When a prior idea is assessed as high-quality, this motivates the crowd to emulate that idea. When this motivation is aligned with subsequent contributions that expand the mental space of the prior idea, a new high-quality idea can be created. In contrast, when a prior idea is assessed as low-quality, it motivates the crowd to redirect away from that idea. When this motivation is aligned with subsequent contributions that shift the mental space of the prior idea, a new high-quality idea can be created. The mixed findings in the literature can then be explained by a failure to consider non-idea information contributions made by the crowd.",,

Yet little is known about whether access to these advanced networking features has a causal impact on the accumulation of SC. To close this research gap, we conducted a randomized field experiment and recruited 215 freelancers in a freemium, work-related SMN. Of these recruited participants, more than 70 received a randomly assigned voucher for a free 12- month premium membership. We observe that individuals do not necessarily accumulate more SC from their ability to access advanced networking features, as the treated freelancers did not automatically change their online networking engagement. Those features only reveal their full utility if individuals are motivated to proactively engage in networking. We found that freelancers who had access to advanced networking features increased their SC by 4.609% for each unit increase on the strategic networking behavior scale. We confirmed this finding in another study utilizing a second, individual-level panel dataset covering 52,392 freelancers. We also investigated the dynamics that active vs. passive features play in SC accumulation. Based on these findings, we introduce the “theory of purposeful feature utilization”: essentially, individuals must not only possess an efficacious “networking weapon”—they also need the intent to “shoot” it.",,

This study examines digital resilience in higher education institutions through the conceptual lens of disaster response management, by assessing the role played by the centralized governance of information technology (IT) investments. We posit that centralized IT helps organizations maintain customer satisfaction with services during a crisis (e.g., student satisfaction with classes during COVID-19) by facilitating the organization-wide transition to an emergency operational mode and supporting its service operations. Consolidating data on IT investment, governance, and course evaluations from 463 U.S. higher education institutions from 2017-2020, we show that centralized IT helped organizations adapt better to the pandemic in terms of maintaining student satisfaction. Moreover, we found that centralized IT investments geared toward facilitating organizational coordination and providing instructional and technical support played a pivotal role in enabling ERT and improving student ratings during the crisis. These results are corroborated by interviews with CIOs of U.S. higher education institutions. Additional analyses also suggest that the effectiveness of centralized IT governance is contingent upon organizational size, dissimilarity of local units, and the strategic role of the CIO.

Although the DC framework provides a theoretical basis, it is unclear what actions managers can take to build DC. Through process tracing, we examine how the Commonwealth of Virginia (COVA) built DCs and rebounded from two shocks—the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. COVA managers leveraged statewide data assets, built routines to disseminate data, and reconfigured operational capabilities to build three DCs—relationship building, intelligence creation, and value extraction. Data functioned as the “protein” to build the digital resilience “muscle.” We found that the relationship building DC leveraged the operational capabilities of data management, integration, and governance structure to foster data sharing, the intelligence creation DC leveraged analytics, and the value extraction DC converted analytics into cost savings, revenue generation, and new services. Whereas COVA built robust digital resilience by facilitating data sharing, the agencies exploited data assets to develop scalable solutions.",,

We use a proprietary dataset that matches online and offline data sources to study the digital resilience of physicians. A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis shows that physicians who adopted an OHC had strong resistance and recovery effects during the pandemic. Remarkably, after the COVID-19 outbreak, these physicians had 35.0% less reduction in medical consultations in the immediate period and 31.0% more bounce-back in the subsequent period as compared to physicians who did not adopt the OHC. We further analyze the sources of physicians’ digital resilience by distinguishing between new and existing patients from both online and offline channels.

Individual contributions by OSS community members to others’ projects and their own determine whether OSS communities are resilient in the face of major shocks. Arguably, if crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic prompt users to reduce their contributions to others’ projects relative to the contributions to their own projects, such behavior can have implications for the overall resilience of the OSS community. Therefore, whether and how individuals change their contributions in the face of a crisis is an important question. We examine whether members in an OSS community increased or decreased their contributions to others’ projects relative to their own in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, a sudden and unexpected global health-related shock that has affected almost everyone. We also compare and contrast this behavior when the OSS community faced increasing unemployment, an economic cyclic shock that is arguably and relatively more personal. Drawing on the concept of prosocial behavior and conservation of resources (COR) theory, we hypothesize that the pandemic increased OSS community members’ contributions to others’ projects relative to their own; on the other hand, the threat of rising unemployment decreased OSS community members’ contributions to others’ projects relative to their own. Our empirical analyses of a longitudinal dataset of over 18,000 OSS community members on GitHub, with more than 1.4 million member-day observations, support our hypotheses.

The focus of this paper is on how firms can optimally manage their ratings through management response and how review ratings affect the sales and profits of competing firms. We develop a controlled diffusion process to model the coevolution of sales and ratings as a function of the response strategy chosen to maximize profit over time. Our model considers a variety of factors, such as profit margin and customer rating sensitivity, that influence a firm’s effort to manage ratings and subsequently its sales and profits. More response effort needs to be exerted to manage ratings when either the profit margin of a tour is very high or customers are very sensitive to ratings. We estimate our model using data on Ctrip’s tours that include each tour’s sales, reviews, prices, and tour features. We find that consumers anchor their beliefs in the mean market rating and that their purchase decisions depend on the tour’s rating relative to this anchor. Thus, relative, rather than absolute, ratings matter. Our study informs firms on how competition and other primitives impact their efforts to manage ratings and hence profit. Our methodology allowed us to conduct “what-if” analyses, for example, to study what would happen to the review ratings, sales, and profits of a tour if a firm adopted a different response strategy. We were also able to provide turnaround strategies for struggling tours, i.e., factors that a loss-making tour should change if it wishes to make a positive profit. Ultimately, we conducted a competitive analysis that allowed us to modify certain parameters that affect the intensity of competition and hence the sales and the profits of competing tours. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of the model by extending it to incorporate multiple state variables that might affect the response strategy.",,

Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention. Our work shows the economic value of emotions in online reviews, generates insight into the mechanism of their effects, and has managerial implications for online review platform design, movie marketing, and cinema operations.",,

Traditional economic theory holds that the crowding effect means that the relative importance of nonexperts in the market will decline over time until they become unimportant. Exploiting a unique period in one crowdfunding market (Prosper.com) that allowed us to directly estimate the net cost of competing with better-informed experts, we found that the net negative effects of expert participation on nonexperts are small. We used simulations to both better understand (1) the market characteristics and crowdfunding platform choices that influence experts’ and nonexperts’ returns, their return gap, and the extent to which nonexperts are better or worse off relative to a market without expert participation, and (2) the factors that may contribute to the small expert/nonexpert Prosper return gap.",,

However, due to formidable methodological challenges, the promise of business value from unstructured multimedia data has not materialized. In this study, we use a design science approach to develop DeepVoice, a novel nonverbal predictive analysis system for financial risk prediction, in the setting of quarterly earnings conference calls. DeepVoice forecasts financial risk by leveraging not only what managers say (verbal linguistic cues) but also how managers say it (vocal cues) during the earnings conference calls. The design of DeepVoice addresses several challenges associated with the analysis of nonverbal communication. We also propose a two-stage deep learning model to effectively integrate managers’ sequential vocal and verbal cues. Using a unique dataset of 6,047 earnings call samples (audio recordings and textual transcripts) of S&P 500 firms across four years, we show that DeepVoice yields remarkably lower risk forecast errors than that achieved by previous efforts. The improvement can also translate into nontrivial economic gains in options trading. The theoretical and practical implications of analyzing vocal cues are discussed.",,

S.",33--62,"Biases on online platforms pose a threat to social inclusion. We examine the influence of a novel source of bias in online philanthropic lending, namely that associated with religious differences. We first propose religion distance as a probabilistic measure of differences between pairs of individuals residing in different countries. We then incorporate this measure into a gravity model of trade to explain variation in country-to-country lending volumes. We further propose a set of contextual moderators that characterize individuals’ offline (local) and online social contexts, which we argue combine to determine the influence of religion distance on lending activity. We empirically estimate our gravity model using data from Kiva.org, reflecting all lending actions that took place between 2006 and 2017. We demonstrate the negative and significant effect of religion distance on lending activity, over and above other established factors in the literature. Further, we demonstrate the moderating role of lenders’ offline social context (diversity, social hostilities, and governmental favoritism of religion) on the aforementioned relationship to online lending behavior. Finally, we offer empirical evidence of the parallel role of online contextual factors, namely those related to community features offered by the Kiva platform (lending teams), which appear to amplify the role of religious bias. In particular, we show that religious team membership is a double-edged sword that has both favorable and unfavorable consequences, increasing lending in general but skewing said lending toward religiously similar borrowers. Our findings speak to the important frictions associated with religious differences in individual philanthropy; they point to the role of governmental policy vis-à-vis religious tolerance as a determinant of citizens’ global philanthropic behavior, and they highlight design implications for online platforms with an eye toward managing religious bias.",,

Replacement is a risky proposition, as high levels of technical and social inertia make these systems hard to withdraw. Failure to fully replace systems results in complex system architectures involving manifold hidden dependencies that carry technical debt. To understand how a process for replacing a complex legacy system unfolds and accumulates technical debt, we conducted an explanatory case study at a local manufacturing site that had struggled to replace its mission-critical legacy systems as part of the larger global company’s commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system implementation. We approach the replacement as a sociotechnical change and leverage the punctuated sociotechnical information system change model in combination with the design-moves framework to analyze how the site balanced creating digital options, countering social inertia, and managing (architectural) technical debt. The findings generalize to a two-level (local/global) system-dynamics model delineating how replacing a deeply entrenched mission-critical system generates positive and negative feedback loops within and between social and technical changes at local and global levels. The loops, unless addressed, accrue technical debt that hinders legacy system discontinuance and gradually locks the organization into a debt-constrained state. The model helps managers anticipate challenges that accompany replacing highly entrenched systems and formulate effective strategies to address them.",,

Yet IT outsourcing suppliers still find it challenging to shift their reputation from the competent provision of a low-end service to a high-value innovative line of services, thus becoming known as business partners. We address this issue by examining the reputation formation efforts of an IT supplier experiencing a reputation deficit in terms of quality (its ability as a business partner) and intent (its intention to adopt trustworthy behavior). We develop a model based on a case study of a large IT supplier engaged in reputation formation with its outsourcing clients. We portray reputation formation as a process wherein an IT supplier alternately emits signals of quality and intent from a repertoire of signals. Our process model distinguishes between signaling at the market level, which relies on rhetorical mediums to broadcast a message promoting the supplier’s ability as a business partner, and signaling at the client level, which relies on substantive mediums such as demonstrations of the supplier’s ability to solve the client’s business problems and behavioral mediums that allow the client to assess the supplier’s intent to adopt trustworthy behavior.",,

What recommendations consumers receive and how they respond to the recommendations largely depend on the design of CF algorithms. However, the extant empirical research on recommender systems has primarily focused on how the presence of recommendations affects product demand, without considering the underlying algorithm design. Leveraging a field experiment on a major e-commerce platform, we examine the differential impact of two widely used CF designs: view-also-view (VAV) and purchase-also-purchase (PAP). We found several striking differences between the impact of these two designs on individual products. First, VAV is about seven times more effective in generating additional product views than PAP but only about twice as effective in generating sales due to a lower conversion rate. Second, VAV is more effective in increasing views for more expensive products, whereas PAP is more effective in increasing the sales of cheaper products. Third, VAV is less effective in increasing the views but more effective in increasing the sales of products with higher purchase incidence rates (PIRs). Finally, when aggregated over all products with the same levels of price or PIRs, VAV dominates PAP in generating views and the difference is more striking for products with higher prices or lower PIRs. Interestingly, PAP is more effective than VAV in increasing the sales of products with low prices or moderate PIRs, though VAV generates more sales than PAP overall. Our findings suggest that platforms may benefit from employing different CF designs for different types of products.",,

More specifically, we found that VOD content-related expenditures increased by 21.5% following smart speaker adoption but the average consumption of VOD content purchased decreased by 3.0%. We also examined millions of data points on TV remote-control use and conducted a survey via MTurk to support the validity of the findings. Smart speaker usage can reduce search costs, which subsequently increases search incidence and conversion rates, behavioral changes that can lead to a rise in purchases. We further show that the use of smart speakers for purposes other than information seeking is positively associated with purchases.

Phishing research has informed effective practical interventions to address phishing susceptibility that emphasize the importance of broadly applicable IT security knowledge. Yet employees still frequently fall victim to phishing attempts. To help understand why, we conceptualize phishing susceptibility as the failure to differentiate between deceptive and legitimate information processing requests that occur within the context of an employee’s typical job responsibilities. We apply this contextual lens to identify characteristics of knowledge workers’ organizational task and social context that may enhance or diminish performance in detecting deception in phishing email attempts. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a study in which employees of the finance division of a large university encountered simulated email-based phishing attempts as part of their normal work routine. We found evidence supporting our hypotheses that an individual’s susceptibility to phishing attacks is influenced by their position in the knowledge flows of the organization and by the impact of workgroup responsibilities on their cognitive processing. We contend that phishing susceptibility is not merely a matter of IT security knowledge but is also influenced by contextualized, multilevel influences on information processing. As phishing attacks are increasingly targeted to specific organizational settings, it is even more important to incorporate this contextualized information processing view of phishing susceptibility.",,

Thanks to this disintermediation, consumers now have access to a vast number of alternatives, while creators can efficiently reach huge markets. However, the success of digital markets has created a concomitant challenge for creators: differentiation. In crowded markets, agencies (e.g., publishing companies in books, freelance agencies in online labor markets, independent labels in music) can differentiate creators by signaling product quality. But how do agencies’ reputations affect product success for creators? Can some agencies do more harm than good? To investigate these research questions, we theorize how variation in creator and agency reputation leads to asymmetric and heterogeneous effects, namely that (1) more reputable agencies have a stronger positive effect on less reputable creators than they have on more reputable creators, and (2) less reputable agencies hurt more reputable creators more than they hurt less reputable ones. Analyses of more than one million observations from two digital markets provide empirical support for these theory-driven arguments. The findings have design implications for markets and contribute to our understanding of how agencies, depending on creator reputation, can either benefit or hurt product success.",,

Prior information systems (IS) research has mostly focused on the role of extreme valence, i.e., the positivity/negativity of information, portrayed by such representations. Yet this bipolar approach discounts how the coexistence of positivity and negativity (i.e., ambivalence) or their absence (i.e., indifference) is formed and leads to distinct attentional processes and outcomes such as purchase decisions. We theorize how and why the valence of information projected through such representations may elicit mixed feelings and influence decision-making in online environments. We conducted four randomized controlled experiments, including an electroencephalography (EEG) study, to disentangle the influence of ambivalence and indifference on decision-making in an online shopping context. We found that ambivalence and indifference to online information distinctly influenced attention and purchase decisions relative to positivity and negativity. Our findings further suggest the inability of incumbent bipolar representations, such as the widely implemented star rating system, to capture the mixed feelings expressed in online content. We propose a bivariate intervention that overcomes the limitations of bipolar representations by not only discerning ambivalence from indifference but also amplifying purchase decisions for products with ambivalent information by at least 50%, compared to incumbent bipolar representations. Our findings advance ongoing research on the role of information valence in online environments and offer implications for practice.",,

We developed an analytical model to study the optimal design of a new retail payment system in terms of settlement speed and system capability under both bank and fintech firm heterogeneous participation incentives. We found that three types of payment systems emerge as equilibrium outcomes: batch retail (BR), expedited retail (ER), and real-time retail (RR) payment systems. Although the base value of the payment service positively affects both settlement speed and system capability, the expected liquidity cost negatively impacts settlement speed, and total transaction volume and technological effectiveness positively impact system capability. We identified three leadership strategies to maximize social welfare: the government mandate (GM) strategy, the fintech-inclusive (FI) strategy, and the fintech-exclusive and bank-exclusive (FE+BE) strategy. When the base value of the payment service is either low or high, the GM strategy leads to a socially optimal unified system. When the base value of the payment service is in the intermediate range, and if fintech firms have a significant technological advantage over banks, then both GM and FI strategies result in a socially optimal unified system; otherwise, the FE+BE strategy results in a socially optimal fragmented system. Further, we proposed a Shapley-value-based cost-sharing rule under the GM strategy to fairly allocate social welfare among the system participants. Our findings offer important policy insights into the optimal system designs, leadership strategies, and the government regulator’s role in shaping future innovations in the payments industry.",,

However, a common belief is that the greater economic cost and complexity of hybrid digital objects (i.e., digital objects with both hardware and software) precludes their development with open source methods traditionally used for software. We study a sophisticated OSH named White Rabbit initiated at CERN and developed through a vibrant and heterogenous open source community. Our findings show that the assumption that hardware and software require fundamentally distinctive development and production modes should be replaced with a more nuanced differentiation characterized by three main attributes describing an object’s composition: embodiment, modularity, and granularity. Taken together, these three attributes determine how a hybrid object is developed throughout its evolution in an open source community. Our research offers several contributions. First, we provide a more nuanced view of the consequences of the material embodiment of hardware. Once considered a simple deterrent to open source development, we describe how economic cost is subordinate to more influential aspects of an object’s physical layers: as the open source community modifies the object to accommodate the operating requirements of diverse physical instantiations, such modifications can be incorporated in the logical design covered by the open source license. Additionally, we show how embodiment, modularity, and granularity progress through the object’s evolution and how this maturation subsequently affects development modes. We trace the implications of our findings for hybrids and digital object conceptualizations in IS research, open source development and, more broadly, normative implications for OSH in scientific and commercial computing.",,

However, for those early-stage investors, information pointing to the success of business-to-business (B2B) new ventures (B2BNVs) is scattered and disconnected. This paper focuses on social media narratives (SMNs) as a source of insight for such investors and proposes that predicting a B2BNV’s likelihood of success requires a comparative view, i.e., a comparison of its SMNs with those of its competitors and customers. We expect that higher (lower) lingual similarity between the SMNs of an early-stage B2BNV and those of its prospective customers (competitors) predict its success. Using a longitudinal panel of 574 B2BNVs resulting in more than 2,700 venture-round observations, we find that a comparative view of a venture’s SMNs can give early-stage investors reliable predictions about the B2BNV’s ability to manage its market presence and its success in later stages. Our models show that a comparative view of SMNs increases the accuracy of predicting a B2BNV’s later-stage fundraising success by an average of 15%. Furthermore, predictive models can reliably point to a successful market presence in later stages, including the landing of customers, the winning of awards and competitions, the receiving of endorsements, the generating of revenue, and the successful patenting of products.

Through a randomized field experiment, we randomly reveal to some investors that a firm producing a product used by musicians is founded by a musician and conceal this founder-related information from other investors. Revealing the information suggests that the firm is a user innovator firm and concealing it suggests that the firm is a traditional producer firm. We find that investors are significantly more interested in the traditional producer firm. Through an additional field experiment, we identify that the bias against user entrepreneurs is statistical (based on a response to limited information) rather than taste based (based on an idiosyncratic dislike).

However, overwhelmingly, crowdfunding campaigns are not meeting their goals. Therefore, it is imperative to examine how the success of charity fundraising campaigns can be improved. In this paper, we focus on the design of project images on a crowdfunding website, which portray the themes and content of the projects. Employing the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model, we investigate the relationships between image attributes (S) and image emotions (O), and between image emotions (O) and campaign outcomes (R). We developed and trained a deep neural network model to identify the emotions conveyed in the images, and then implemented it to analyze project images from a popular crowdfunding platform. We applied the obtained image emotions together with the objective image attributes and the project outcome metrics to explore from a design perspective, what image attributes evoke image emotions, and how image emotions are related to the success of charity fundraising projects. Our results confirm these relationships and further suggest that the roles of image emotions on the success of crowdfunding campaigns vary with project characteristics such as the project budget and category. In addition, the image emotions of competing projects on the crowdfunding platform were found to reduce the project’s performance. In an extended study, we conducted an online randomized controlled experiment by manipulating image attributes to reexamine the causal relationships and verify the mediating roles of positive and negative empathies between image emotions and campaign outcomes. This research contributes to the charity fundraising literature from a novel perspective of emotions in project images. It presents new and unique findings regarding the mediation roles of positive and negative empathies and the limitations of the emotion of sadness in certain types of charity fundraising.

Specifically, the persuasive effect of emoticons occurs for both positive and negative eWOM when recipients and senders are close to each other. However, this effect occurs only for negative eWOM when recipients and senders have distant relationships.

We conducted an exploratory study, in the context of information technology (IT) use, to examine if the PGS approach can be used to better understand the role of genetics in IS research. Consistent with our hypotheses, genetic endowments associated with Educational Attainment and General Cognition positively predict technology use, and genetic endowments associated with Neuroticism, Depressive Symptoms, Myocardial Infarction, and Coronary Artery Disease negatively predict technology use more than half a century later (genetic endowments are established at conception and our sample consists of individuals aged 50 to 80). Many of the characteristics known to be associated with heterogeneity in IT use (e.g., trust, education) appear to be mediators linking PGSs to IT use. Nonetheless, a number of PGSs maintain meaningful direct effects.",,

Our identification strategy relies on the fact that the Airbnb Plus service was launched in different cities at different times, and listings within the cities received the certification at different times. Using a staggered difference-in-differences estimation strategy in conjunction with suitable matching methods, we found that the Airbnb Plus certification increased the weekly booking rate of Plus listings by about 6.8% on average (direct effect). We also found some evidence that non-Plus listings saw a temporary decline in booking rate when one or more nearby properties received a Plus certification (externality effect). The net impact of the Airbnb Plus service on the platform itself was an annual increase in revenue of about $37,500 for the average 2-kilometer zone in a U.S. city that included one or more Plus listings, as compared to matched zones without any Plus listings (local platform effect). We performed additional analyses, including a randomized experiment, to demonstrate the robustness of our findings. Overall, our results suggest that platform-endorsed quality certification has significant economic impacts—not just on the listings that receive the certification but on other listings on the platform as well as on the platform itself.",,

Interface Design Coordination between Software Platforms and Hosted Apps,"Zhang, Cheng and Song, Peijian and Lim, Kai",1333--1352,"Software platform ecosystems are emerging as a dominant model for IT-based services. To accelerate third-party development, platform owners often waive restrictions on app user interfaces to provide app developers with more autonomy in interface design. The literature has indicated, however, that standardized interface design across products is a strategic necessity for firms to introduce and manage their product lines, suggesting that platform owners should not waive restrictions on app user interfaces. This tension between the two approaches raises a crucial research question: Does standardized interface design used by apps and their host platform benefit the platform and apps that it hosts? Specifically, does the coordinated design approach enhance or hinder usage between the platform and apps such that apps attract usage from their host platform and vice versa? Drawing on the theory of basic Gestalts, we theorize the three interface design properties of interface similarity, embeddedness, and synchrony, and extend the theory to investigate how these properties help both apps and their host platform attract each other’s users, thus reflecting derivative usage between them. We performed a randomized field experiment to test the proposed hypotheses. The results reveal that interface similarity, embeddedness, and synchrony of the app-platform interface design strengthen users’ grouping perception of the platform and its apps, thus enhancing platform-to-app forward derivative usage. Contrary to our expectations, we found that this strengthened grouping perception does not improve the app-to-platform backward derivative usage. These findings have crucial implications for the value of interface design in software platform ecosystems.",,

Nevertheless, healthcare practitioners are reluctant to adopt those models as they are less transparent and accountable due to their black-box structure.

Therefore, we propose the RObust Local EXplanations (ROLEX) method to develop robust, instance-level explanations for HPA models in this study. ROLEX adapts state-of-the-art methods and ameliorates their shortcomings in explaining individual-level predictions made by black-box machine learning models. Our analysis with a large real-world dataset related to a prevalent medical condition called fragility fracture and two publicly available healthcare datasets reveals that ROLEX outperforms widely accepted benchmark methods in terms of local faithfulness of explanations. In addition, ROLEX is more robust since it does not rely on extensive hyperparameter tuning or heuristic algorithms. Explanations generated by ROLEX, along with the prototype user interface presented in this study, have the potential to promote personalized care and precision medicine by providing patient-level interpretations and novel insights.

This study seeks to address this question by (1) undertaking a meta-analysis of studies investigating the turnover intentions of IT professionals, and by (2) conducting a second-order meta-analysis to compare findings between IT and non-IT professionals. The meta-analytic findings identify new antecedents more recently examined in information systems (IS) research while confirming enduring relationships between antecedents and turnover intention.

Three types of expert knowledge are essential to effective industry assignment: definition-based knowledge (i.e., expert definitions of each industry), structure-based knowledge (i.e., structural relationships among industries as specified in an ICS), and assignment-based knowledge (i.e., prior firm-industry assignments performed by domain experts). Existing industry assignment methods utilize only assignment-based knowledge to learn a model that classifies unassigned firms to industries, overlooking definition-based and structure-based knowledge. Moreover, these methods only consider which industry a firm has been assigned to, ignoring the time-specificity of assignment-based knowledge, i.e., when the assignment occurs. To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose a novel deep learning-based method that not only seamlessly integrates the three types of knowledge for industry assignment but also takes the time-specificity of assignment-based knowledge into account. Methodologically, our method features two innovations: dynamic industry representation and hierarchical assignment. The former represents an industry as a sequence of time-specific vectors by integrating the three types of knowledge through our proposed temporal and spatial aggregation mechanisms. The latter takes industry and firm representations as inputs, computes the probability of assigning a firm to different industries, and assigns the firm to the industry with the highest probability. We conduct extensive evaluations with two widely used ICSs and demonstrate the superiority of our method over prevalent existing methods.",,

The use of economic incentives under the ubiquitous mobile ecosystem for prosocial behavior has been shown to be particularly effective. We build on the previous work on this topic and study how mobile-based economic incentives and environments influence charitable giving behavior. In contrast to traditional fund-raising, we consider the use of mobile devices to generate giving in small denominations, which we term microgiving. In collaboration with a US-based mobile app provider, we incorporated a functionality that allowed users to contribute their in-app reward points to charity. To encourage donations, we used economic incentives in the form of monetary subsidies, i.e., rebates or matching grants, as well as digital nudges in the form of push notifications. We studied the effects of these factors on giving behavior across two large-scale field experiments. Focusing on the different aspects of smartphones that could differentially impact charitable giving behavior—namely the intensely private and personal nature of smartphones—we examined how the visibility of donation decisions affects giving behavior by toggling audience effects. Our results show that the effectiveness of incentives is contingent upon the magnitude of the incentive as well as the extent to which individual decisions are visible to others. To situate our results in relation to the traditional medium of charitable giving, we propose an analytical model that internalizes the subsidy rates and the audience effect.

WFF pricing is a strategy in which consumers are given the option to either wait a certain amount of time to acquire digital content at no cost or pay to consume it immediately. We evaluate the extent to which habit formation and present-biased preferences driven by the consumption of addictive stock affect individual consumers’ willingness to wait (or pay) for content, which, in turn, determines the efficacy of WFF pricing. We also examine the conditions under which consumers switch from waiting for free content to instantaneously purchasing content. Our findings indicate that WFF pricing increases the sales of serialized digital content, generating new demand from customers who would otherwise forgo participation in the market. In addition, the pricing design effectively generates sustained profits in the long run. We found that most consumers who initiate a purchase either upon initial market entry or upon switching continue to purchase as new episodes become available. Moreover, the results indicate that as a user accumulates free episodes of a specific series, given extended waiting periods, the likelihood of their conversion from a wait-for-free customer to an instant-purchase customer increases. In particular, WFF pricing effectively augments the willingness to pay of low-valuation consumers as habit formation builds up through time with the free consumption of serialized content. One free episode can elevate the likelihood of consumer purchase by up to 13%. However, as the number of free episodes consumed goes beyond a threshold, the likelihood of conversion decreases. We conclude with a discussion of managerial implications that can help content providers monetize their serialized digital content products.",,

Several underlying mechanisms were revealed by our quantitative and qualitative analysis. First, retailers are more likely to comply due to the greater monitoring effectiveness enabled by AI assistance. Second, the positive effect of IIP-based shelf monitoring partially persists after it is terminated, implying that human learning takes place. Third, the value of IIP-based shelf monitoring can be attributed to independent retailers rather than chain retailers. Since the degree of contract heterogeneity is the major difference between these retailers in terms of monitoring, this finding further suggests that AI is relatively more scalable when coping with more heterogeneous instances. Apart from these great benefits, we demonstrate the low marginal costs of implementing IIP-powered shelf monitoring, which indicates its long-term applicability and potential to generate incremental value.

Using a unique data set on two completion-contingent incentive programs from a popular online aesthetic medicine platform, we examine user responses to reward thresholds. We found that after users reach a threshold to obtain a monetary reward, they are less likely to continue contributing UGC, suggesting a minimal-effort effect.

Does such a lack of social presence affect service interactions? We studied this timely question by evaluating the impact of customers’ perceived social presence on service outcomes and customers’ attitudes toward agents. Our identification strategy hinged on Southwest Airlines’ sudden requirement to include a first name in response to service requests on Twitter, which enhanced customers’ perceived level of social presence. This change led customers to become more willing to engage and more likely to reach a resolution upon engagement. We further conducted a randomized experiment to understand the underlying mechanisms. We found that the effects were mainly driven by customers who were ex ante uncertain or suspicious about the human identity of agents, and the presence of identity cues improved service outcomes by enhancing customers’ perceived levels of trust and empathy. Additionally, we found no evidence of elevated verbal aggression from customers toward agents with identity cues, although a mechanism test revealed the moderating role of customers’ emotional states.

Specifically, when a renter (customer) complaint about a host (provider) occurs, we sent reminder messages to other unaffected hosts in the same neighborhoods (as the affected host) and urged them to proactively prevent similar complaints. The reminder messages varied in terms of their emphasis of the roles of different stakeholders in platform-based value co-creation (provider-emphasized vs. customer-emphasized) and how they explicated different value appropriation mechanisms (competition-based vs. cooperation-based). Results show that compared to the control message, customer-emphasized messages effectively motivated providers’ proactive efforts to reduce customer complaints. Contrastingly, provider-emphasized messages led to the undesirable outcome of increasing customer complaints, possibly due to providers’ shirking behavior. We also found that a competition-based value appropriation mechanism strengthened the motivating effect, whereas a cooperation-based mechanism undermined the motivating effect.

Given textual corpora, such as consumer reviews and online discussion forums, researchers and business practitioners often use topic modeling to either explore data in an unsupervised fashion or generate variables of interest for subsequent econometric analysis. However, one important concern stems from the fact that topic models can be notorious for their instability, i.e., the generated results could be inconsistent and irreproducible at different times, even on the same dataset. Therefore, researchers might arrive at potentially unreliable results regarding the theoretical relationships that they are testing or developing. In this paper, we attempt to highlight this problem and suggest a potential approach to addressing it. First, we empirically define and evaluate the stability problem of topic models using four textual datasets. Next, to alleviate the problem and with the goal of extracting actionable insights from textual data, we propose a new method, Stable LDA, which incorporates topical word clusters into the topic model to steer the model inference toward consistent results. We show that the proposed Stable LDA approach can significantly improve model stability while maintaining or even improving the topic model quality. Further, employing two case studies related to an online knowledge community and online consumer reviews, we demonstrate that the variables generated from Stable LDA can lead to more consistent estimations in econometric analyses.

We apply a difference-in-differences design to explore the drivers and effects of the timing of platform owners’ entry using data from three entries that Amazon made into its Alexa voice assistant’s complementary markets. Our findings suggest that early entry is driven by the motivation to boost the overall value creation of the complementary market, whereas late entry is driven by the motivation to capture value already created in a key complementary market. Importantly, our findings suggest that early entry, in contrast to late entry, creates substantial consumer attention that benefits complementors offering specialized functionality. In addition, the findings also suggest that complementors with more experience are more likely to benefit from the increased consumer attention. We contribute to platform research by showing that the timing of the platform owner’s entry matters in a way that can potentially reconcile conflicting findings regarding the consequences of platform owners’ entry into complementary markets.",,

Self-distancing theory posits that psychological distance enables individuals to reflect on psychologically distant negative experiences more genuinely, in a less biased way. This raises the question of whether the positivity bias in ratings due to psychological distance persists for negative experiences. To address this question, we collected data from a large review platform that enables the identification of reviewers’ spatial and temporal distance. The negativity of an experience was operationalized via review text sentiment. We introduced spatial and temporal distance as moderators between sentiment negativity and ratings and found a negative moderation by spatial distance and a positive moderation by temporal distance. Our findings indicate that the relationship between sentiment negativity and rating grows stronger under spatial distance and gets weaker under temporal distance. Text mining confirmed self-distancing as the driver behind the spatial moderation and construal levels as the driver behind the temporal moderation. We attribute the asymmetric moderations to differences in the tangibility of spatial distance (more tangible) and temporal distance (less tangible).

Our findings show that the affordances arising from features with varying degrees of ephemerality (i.e., snaps and stories) differ from those of permanent content features in terms of self-presentation, browsing others’ content, and communication. Adopting a multidimensional conceptualization of user engagement, we show the positive (e.g., more content sharing) and negative (e.g., cognitive burden from context loss) effects for snaps and stories that should be cautiously considered by social media platforms aiming to introduce such features. Finally, we reveal new user behaviors that relate to sharing snapshots of fleeting value as snaps or experiences of transient value as stories.",,

The political sphere is no exception. In response to the impact that social media influencers have on citizens’ political views and voting behaviors, political parties adapt their messages and policies during election campaigns. Media outlets, too, faced with competition for readership from social media, are adjusting their news coverage. To analyze the nature and extent of the impact of social media on parties’ policies, media outlets’ news reports, and citizens’ opinions, we used a game theoretical model of electoral competition involving four key stakeholders—citizens, political parties, media outlets, and social media influencers. Our results show that with social media, parties’ policy positions become more moderate while media outlets’ editorial positions become more extreme. We also show that citizens’ opinions may become more polarized when the influencers’ true editorial positions are more homogeneous as a result of increased information distortion.",,

We propose that parental privacy concerns decrease adolescents’ self-disclosure both directly (i.e., compliance) and indirectly through adolescents’ privacy concerns (i.e., internalization) and that such effects are moderated by parent-child privacy dissonance, parental internet evaluative mediation, and adolescents’ gender. To test the research model, we collected matched parent-child data from 726 families in China. The results show the indirect effect of parental privacy concerns on adolescents’ self-disclosure via their influence on adolescents’ privacy concerns. In addition, parent-child privacy dissonance weakens the effect of adolescents’ privacy concerns on self-disclosure. The extent to which parents employ internet evaluative mediation to guide adolescents’ online activities reinforces the effect of parental privacy concerns on adolescents’ privacy concerns. Statistical analyses further revealed that the mediating effect of adolescents’ privacy concerns is weakened by parent-child privacy dissonance but strengthened by internet evaluative mediation. We also found that parental privacy concerns affect sons and daughters through different paths, especially when parents employ high internet evaluative mediation. Under high internet evaluative mediation, parental privacy concerns affect sons’ self-disclosure primarily through an indirect path (via sons’ privacy concerns), but influence daughters’ self-disclosure both directly and indirectly via daughters’ privacy concerns. We conclude by discussing theoretical contributions and practical implications.",,

However, the increasing ubiquity of IT at work can disrupt employees’ flow. Thus, the impact of IT-mediated interruptions on flow warrants more attention in research and practice. We conducted a NeuroIS laboratory experiment focusing on a typical office work task—an invoice matching task (i.e., matching customer payments to invoices). We manipulated interruption frequency (low, high) and content relevance (irrelevant, relevant) to study the impact of interruptions on self-reported flow, its dimensions, and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV; calculated from electrocardiography recordings) as a proxy for parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activation. We found that content relevance moderated the relationship between interruption frequency and self-reported flow and that these results vary along flow dimensions. Content relevance also moderated the relationship between interruption frequency and PNS activation. Furthermore, self-reported flow was positively associated with both perceived and objective task performance, while PNS activation was not related to either performance measure. Lastly, we found no relationship between PNS activation (measured by HF-HRV) and self-reported flow, contributing to an important debate in the NeuroIS literature on whether physiological evidence constitutes an alternative or a complement to self-reports. Overall, our findings indicate that frequent interruptions are not harmful per se. Rather, considering content relevance is critical for a more comprehensive understanding of the effects on self-reported flow, its dimensions, and the underlying physiology.",,

Sellers can control the price paid and make a proportion of their stock available in auction presales. Anything left after presales is sold via auctions. Our analysis of nearly 1.5 million flower lots reveals a positive effect with higher auction prices and total revenue for lots listed in presales than for lots that are not. The result holds even for lots with no actual sales in the presales, indicating that buyers pay close attention to the additional information from the posted-price presales channel. By teasing out the information effect of presales prices and presales quantity on auction prices, we evaluate a number of pricing strategies. The results suggest that selling at a high price in presales is still more beneficial than selling more by discounting prices.",,

The Case of Financial Risk Assessment and A New Perspective on Alternative Data,"Lu, Tian and Zhang, Yingjie and Li, Beibei",1517--1556,"The importance of pursuing financial inclusion to accelerate economic growth and enhance financial sustainability has been well noted. However, studies have provided few actionable insights into how financial institutions can balance the potential socioeconomic trade-off between profitability and equality. One major challenge arises from a lack of understanding of the impacts of various types of market information available on financial equality beyond economic profitability. Another challenge lies in how the socioeconomic trade-off under a large set of counterfactual policies in a real-world setting can be evaluated. Our motivation for the present study was the emerging sources of digitized user-behavior data (i.e., “alternative data”) stemming from the high penetration of mobile devices and internet access. Accordingly, we investigated how alternative data from smartphones and social media can help mitigate potential financial inequality while preserving business profitability in the context of financial credit risk assessment. We partnered with a leading microloan website to design a novel “meta” experiment that allowed us to simulate various real-world field experiments under an exhaustive set of counterfactual policies. Interestingly, we found that profiling user financial risk using smartphone activities is 1.3 times more effective in improving financial inclusion than using online social media information (23.05% better vs. 18.11%), and nearly 1.3 times more effective in improving business profitability (42% better vs. 33%). Surprisingly, we found that using consumers’ online shopping activities for credit risk profiling can hurt financial inclusion. Furthermore, we investigated potential explanations for financial inclusion improvements. Our findings suggest that alternative data, especially users’ smartphone activities, not only demonstrate higher ubiquity but also appear to be more orthogonal to conventional sensitive demographic attributes. This, in turn, can help mitigate statistical bias driven by the unobserved factors or underrepresentative training samples in machine-based risk assessment processes.",,

While previous studies on credit scoring have mostly focused on single-period loan default prediction, we call for a new avenue—multiperiod default prediction (MPDP)—to depict risk profiles over time. To address the challenges raised by MPDP, such as monotonic default probability prediction and complex relationship accommodation, we propose a novel approach, hybrid and collective scoring (HACS). We design a hybrid modeling strategy to predict whether and when a borrower will default separately through a default discrimination model and a default time estimation model, respectively, and synthesize them through a probabilistic framework. To accommodate various possible patterns of default time and measure the distribution of default probability over successive time intervals, we propose a joint default modeling method to train the default time estimation model. Empirical evaluations at the model (time-to-default prediction performance and discrimination performance) and mechanism (identifiability and discriminability) levels, as well as impact analyses at the application (granting performance and profitability performance) level, show that HACS outperforms the benchmarked survival analysis and multilabel learning methods on all fronts.

Rivalry restraint theory suggests that MHS with multimarket contact (MMC) can tacitly collude and mutually forebear from price competition to keep their prices above competitive levels. We posit that the success of such MMC-induced rivalry restraints (the truce) is affected by two conflicting roles of IT at the corporate level and market unit levels, respectively. The corporate parent seeks to standardize IT applications enterprise-wide to coordinate market units as a means of jointly implementing the rivalry restraint strategy and keeping prices high enterprise-wide. However, market units, i.e., the member hospitals of MHS clustered in geographic patient markets, face competitive pressures to reduce their service costs. Market units seek to use differentiated IT applications to achieve cost reductions, which then fuel price competition in local markets, jeopardize the sustainability of the truce, and weaken the enterprise-wide price effects of the corporate parent’s rivalry restraint strategy. In a longitudinal study of 195 multihospital systems in the U.S. in the 2005-2013 time period, we found support for these ideas. The corporate-wide standardization of the operational IT of MHS complements the rivalry restraint strategy to increase enterprise-wide prices. Market units’ use of differentiated analytical IT reduces costs in local markets and weakens the price effects of the rivalry restraint strategy. The study advances IS research and practice by theorizing how the corporate-level and the market unit-level IT of a multi-unit, multimarket (MUMM) organization can have opposing moderating effects on the link between MMC and the average prices charged by the MUMM organization.",,

In our multistage study, physicians used a machine learning-based (ML) clinical decision support system (CDSS) to see if and how this interaction can stimulate reflective practice in the context of an X-ray diagnosis task. By analyzing verbal protocols, performance metrics, and survey data, we developed an integrative theoretical foundation to explain how ML-based systems can help stimulate reflective practice. Individuals engage in more critical or shallower modes depending on whether they perceive a conflict or agreement with these CDSS systems, which in turn leads to different levels of reflection depth. By uncovering the process of machine-induced reflections, we offer IS research a different perspective on how such AI-based systems can help individuals become more reflective, and consequently more effective, professionals. This perspective stands in stark contrast to the traditional, efficiency-focused view of ML-based decision support systems and also enriches theories on human-AI augmentation.",,

Implicit Associations and the Transience of Algorithm Aversion,"Turel, Ofir and Kalhan, Shivam",1369--1394,"Algorithm aversion is an important and persistent issue that prevents harvesting the benefits of advancements in artificial intelligence. The literature thus far has provided explanations that primarily focus on conscious reflective processes. Here, we supplement this view by taking an unconscious perspective that can be highly informative. Building on theories of implicit prejudice, in a preregistered study, we suggest that people develop an implicit bias (i.e., prejudice) against artificial intelligence (AI) systems, as a different and threatening “species,” the behavior of which is unknown. Like in other contexts of prejudice, we expected people to be guided by this implicit bias but try to override it. This leads to some willingness to rely on algorithmic advice (appreciation), which is reduced as a function of people’s implicit prejudice against the machine. Next, building on the somatic marker hypothesis and the accessibility-diagnosticity perspective, we provide an explanation as to why aversion is ephemeral. As people learn about the performance of an algorithm, they depend less on primal implicit biases when deciding whether to rely on the AI’s advice. Two studies (n1 = 675, n2 = 317) that use the implicit association test consistently support this view. Two additional studies (n3 = 255, n4 = 332) rule out alternative explanations and provide stronger support for our assertions. The findings ultimately suggest that moving the needle between aversion and appreciation depends initially on one’s general unconscious bias against AI because there is insufficient information to override it. They further suggest that in later use stages, this shift depends on accessibility to diagnostic information about the AI’s performance, which reduces the weight given to unconscious prejudice.",,

Accordingly, it is necessary for researchers and practitioners to develop effective and efficient text analysis tools to understand the massive amount of user-generated content (UGC) on OKCs. Unsupervised topic modeling has been widely adopted to extract human-interpretable latent topics embedded in texts. These identified topics can be further used in subsequent analysis and managerial practices. However, existing generic topic models that assume documents are independent are inappropriate for analyzing OKCs where structural relationships exist between questions and answers. Thus, a new method is needed to fill this research gap. In this study, we propose a new topic model specifically designed for the text in OKCs. We make three primary contributions to the research on topic modeling in this context. First, we build a general and flexible Bayesian framework to explicitly model structural and temporal dependencies among texts. Second, we statistically demonstrate the approximate model inference using mean-field and coordinate ascent algorithms. Third, we showcase the practical value and relative merit of our method via a specific downstream task (i.e., user profiling).

To address this important gap, the current study builds on the extended team knowledge framework to identify collaboration technology features and decodes their influencing mechanisms on IT project team creativity by drawing on the novel creative synthesis theory originating in the management literature to the IT project team context.

We then draw on legal scholarship to analyze how strong smart contracts, which refer to agreements with automatic execution and enforcement that are not reversible by courts, rely on a new level of digitization of transaction terms. Specifically, these contracts may rely on standard digital infrastructures such as blockchain systems that guarantee automatic execution and non-reversibility. Strong smart contracts represent a distinct mode of transaction governance compared to markets, hierarchies, or hybrids. This is because each classic governance mode is distinguished by how ex post adaptation is handled—through public courts, managerial fiat, or both. In contrast, strong smart contracts prevent ex post adaptation altogether. We propose that when strong smart contracts can be fully specified, they may dominate other governance modes based on certain trade-offs. These trade-offs include weighing the benefits of avoiding the holdup problem and lowering contract enforcement costs against the downsides of high ex ante specification costs and the elimination of flexibility to make ex post adjustments in a changing environment.

In this paper, we examine a scenario in which an analytics service plays a vital role in enhancing sellers’ understanding of market size and improving their decision-making. Using a game-theoretic model, we analyze the pricing strategies of the platform and the adoption strategies of sellers for the analytics service. Our study identifies two distinct effects of analytics services: the competition effect and the accuracy effect. Specifically, the competition effect manifests in opposing ways across different market scenarios, with a competition-intensifying effect in low-demand markets and a competition-weakening effect in high-demand markets. Consequently, sellers using an analytics service command lower prices in low-demand markets and higher prices in high-demand markets. More interestingly, our results reveal that offering an analytics service could potentially hurt the total market demand, subsequently impacting the platform’s revenue from the marketplace service and potentially leaving the platform worse off. Additionally, driven by both the accuracy and competition effects, adopting an analytics service may adversely affect seller profitability and consumer surplus without necessarily improving overall welfare. Moreover, the transaction fee for the marketplace service plays a crucial role in the interplay between the analytics and marketplace services. Specifically, in low-demand (high-demand) markets, as the transaction fee increases, platforms should consider reducing (increasing) the subscription fee to encourage more (fewer) sellers to adopt the analytics service, thereby enhancing overall market demand and increasing revenue from the marketplace service. Our findings also suggest that platforms should refrain from offering analytics services in high-demand markets when the transaction fee is relatively high. Furthermore, policymakers (sellers) should be mindful of the potential negative consequences associated with the adoption of analytics services in high-demand (low-demand) markets.",,

We collected a sample of 675 public firms from 1997 to 2004 at the module level, enabling us to distinguish enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems from customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain management (SCM) systems. Our data contained the timing of purchase and “go-live” events of these system modules, helping us understand firms’ detailed implementation decisions. We found that IES returns depend on the choices of ERP and CRM/SCM module foundation, ERP-CRM/SCM sequential connection, and the continued adoption of ERP and CRM/SCM modules. Fewer ERP or CRM/SCM modules at CRM/SCM go-live events, a quicker connection between ERP and CRM/SCM go-live events, and the continued adoption of ERP or CRM/SCM modules all were found to enhance IES returns. Our findings show that the agile strategy leads to more returns from IES than the phased strategy and suggest that firms should integrate multiple enterprise systems by going live with advanced system modules quickly after going live with basic enterprise system modules and by continually adding new modules.",,

In particular, we theorize and examine how two features of initial user comments (i.e., sentiment and controversialness) and two features of firm responses (i.e., uniqueness and timeliness) jointly affect the volume and sentiment of subsequent user comments. By analyzing data from the Facebook business pages of multiple U.S. retailers (10,312 firm posts from 37 firms and over 1 million user comments), we found that firms are more likely to respond to negative comments (than positive or neutral comments) but less likely to respond to controversial comments (which evoke diverse opinions and emotions). Further, we found that engaging with negative and controversial comments and promptly responding to comments are linked to an increase in the volume of subsequent user comments but also to a more negative sentiment in these comments.

To illustrate our argument empirically, we use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and identify four configurations of high- and low-intensity technostressors that lead to high job burnout and one that leads to low job performance. We show that three types of interdependencies among technostressors, i.e., complementarity, contingency, and substitution, form configurations that lead to technostrain. Within these configurations, high-intensity technostressors can mutually enhance their effects and low-intensity technostressors can buffer the impact of other high-intensity technostressors on technostrain. The results help to explain why organizational interventions that address independent technostressors may fail if they do not account for the interdependencies among technostressors. Our work provides evidence of the need to further develop theories that explain how and why interdependencies among technostressors lead to technostrain.",,

In this study, we delve into in-consumption information cues (ICICs), indicators that depict fluctuating video quality in real time. Drawing from a natural experiment on a live streaming platform, we evaluate the effects of engagement graphs. These are visual timelines that emphasize moments favored by prior viewers in video-on-demand (VOD) content, which represent full replays of live stream sessions. Notably, these graphs are only accessible to iOS users, leaving Android users without access. Our results show that ICICs enhance the viewership of VODs and live streams. Moreover, viewers tend to spend more time immersed in live broadcasts, suggesting heightened content appeal. Yet, these engagement graphs do not prompt users to donate more virtual gifts, a vital income stream for streamers. Even with the introduction of ICICs, while there is a rise in video production, the inherent structure of live streams remained largely unchanged. We conclude by discussing the academic and managerial implications of these findings.",,

Leveraging field data on a social networking site, we found that reporting a higher level of self-effort increases the digital reaction of likes. To our surprise, expressing gratitude for the sponsor’s efforts also increased likes for such self-disclosures. Through lab experiments that emulated this context, we dissected this paradox by separating the positive effect of expressing gratitude and the negative effect of sharing credit with other stakeholders on likes. Further, we underscore the salience of expressing gratitude, even when gratitude was extended to sponsors with bad reputations.

The rising complexity of market opportunities requires collaboration among multiple partner firms. However, this multipartner collaboration increases transaction and production costs when generating innovations. To address these challenges, incumbents build B2B innovation platforms with mechanisms to reduce partners’ transaction and production costs. We do not yet know if and when partners would choose to use the incumbent’s traditional service innovation model or the B2B innovation platform and how this choice would affect the generativity and profitability of innovations for the incumbent and the partners. We used agent-based modeling and simulation to develop a theory to address these questions. We found that the complexity of market opportunities interacts with the B2B innovation platform’s transaction and production mechanisms to jointly affect whether partners use the platform and when the incumbent and partners achieve generativity and profitability. When the complexity of market opportunities is low, partners use the traditional service innovation model. As complexity increases to medium or high levels, partners begin to use the B2B innovation platform mechanisms to address the transaction and production challenges presented by the complexity of market opportunities. However, there are limits to how much the platform mechanisms can address these challenges. The complexity of market opportunities inhibits the emergence of network effects on B2B innovation platforms and limits the generativity and profitability of platform partners. There are diminishing benefits of investing in the platform’s transaction and production mechanisms, and complexity affects whether the platform owner or the partners profit from innovations generated on the platform.",,

We conducted five experiments, plus a field validation using secondary data. When presented by celebrities and well-known media firms, a commingled partisan falsehood in an otherwise true news story significantly increased viewing and sharing intentions among politically aligned viewers. The effect was weaker but significant when we replaced the celebrity with an unknown speaker and disappeared when both the celebrity and the well-known firm were replaced by unknowns. This effect was explained by confirmation bias and the viewer’s belief that the falsehood was true. In contrast, a false news story focusing on the same falsehood increased viewing and sharing intentions only when presented by unknowns, with viewers’ belief playing a limited role. The field study found a significantly positive relationship between a commingled partisan falsehood in videos of well-known media firms and actual viewership. We conclude that commingled partisan falsehoods provide a significant viewership increase for celebrities and well-known media firms, creating an economic incentive for lying and posing complex challenges in the fake news era.

How Showrooms on Social Media Fan Pages Influence Customer Behavior,"Jung, Jaehwuen and Wang, Shuting (Ada) and Wattal, Sunil",521--550,"While marketing on social media fan pages has received widespread research attention, few studies have investigated the impact of adding a showroom to a social media fan page. Showrooms on social media fan pages are unique in that they can amplify the conflicts between businesses’ commercial purposes (selling) and customers’ expectations (socializing) on social media, making it unclear how they might influence customer behavior. In this study, we open this black box by using data from a leading fashion retailer. We found that adding a showroom to a fan page has both positive implications, in that it leads to more user engagement and purchases, and negative implications, in that it leads users to “unfollow” the retailer’s social media fan page. We further found that such impact is moderated by customer willingness to disclose private information. Specifically, the positive (negative) implication is significantly greater (smaller) for customers who are willing to disclose their private information to the retailer on social media. Mechanism-level analyses suggest that adding a showroom to a fan page can increase customer purchases both directly and indirectly by facilitating their engagement with the fan page and that customer willingness to disclose private information negatively moderates the mediation effect of user engagement on purchase behavior. In addition, results from an online experiment indicate that such showrooms can increase unfollowing by undermining users’ social perception of the fan page and raising users’ privacy concerns. Our findings suggest that even when firms see a significant increase in user purchase and activities after adding a showroom on their fan pages, they should carefully consider the potential risk of driving away customers and strategically target users who are less privacy sensitive.",,

We present the case of Open Targets, a precompetitive collaboration in the life sciences, where publicly funded research, nonprofit foundations, and for-profit pharma collaborate to generate and share data in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. We theorize about the process of data commoning, a political activity in the semicommons where data are created, evidential value is assembled, and scientific meaning converges as data travels, or journeys, across creators, validators, and users.

Although information technology (IT) is a means to cope with uncertainty, chief executive officers (CEOs) may not always support IT investments due to the risky nature of IT, especially when facing uncertain conditions. While prior research suggests that CEO long-term compensation positively incentivizes IT investments, little is known about how different loci of uncertainty impact this relationship. To address this research gap, we study how firm-specific uncertainty and competitive uncertainty shape the influence of CEO long-term compensation on a firm’s IT capital investment. Drawing on agency theory and prospect theory, we develop two hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that firm-specific uncertainty and competitive uncertainty positively moderate the influence of CEO long-term compensation on firm IT capital investment. Second, we hypothesize that competitive uncertainty has a stronger positive moderating effect than firm-specific uncertainty on the influence of CEO long-term compensation on firm IT capital investment. Our analysis of secondary longitudinal data from 2000 to 2007 of 357 public firms in the United States supports our hypotheses. In exploratory analyses, we found that CEO long-term compensation results in a higher risk-oriented dominant logic in the firm, particularly in conditions of firm-specific uncertainty and competitive uncertainty, with competitive uncertainty having a stronger positive moderating effect. These findings uncover risk-oriented dominant logic as a theoretical mechanism that explains how CEO long-term compensation positively influences firm IT capital investment in uncertain conditions. We also conducted exploratory analyses using a different secondary dataset of 286 U.S. public firms from 2004 to 2019 to consider firm investments in transformative IT applications and found support for our theory. This finding triangulates our results across different time periods and different types of IT investments.

We designed a DSR methodology that extends existing approaches by adding a complementary organizing logic to address complexity.

This study examines how a firm’s DSP affects firm performance. Drawing on the competitive dynamics perspective and contingency view, we demonstrate that DSP influences competitive actions through dual pathways. First, DSP enables firms to take competitive actions that are more appropriate given the level of environmental uncertainty (captured by industry dynamism). In particular, our findings suggest that a proactive DSP enables relatively more innovation-oriented actions in dynamic industries while enabling relatively more operations-oriented actions in less dynamic industries. Second, DSP plays a facilitating role in firms’ execution of competitive actions such that a firm’s value from its proactive DSP is enhanced when there is a fit between the type of the firm’s competitive actions and its level of environmental uncertainty. Specifically, we find that firms with a more proactive DSP achieve superior firm performance from innovation-oriented actions in dynamic industries and from operations-oriented actions in less dynamic industries. Taken together, our findings suggest that a proactive DSP not only allows firms to take appropriate competitive actions that fit their environmental conditions but also contributes to firms’ performance by facilitating the execution of these appropriate actions, thus enhancing their efficacy.

Building on research demonstrating the use of nudges to shape behavior, we report the results of an experiment to nudge teamwork in 168 temporary online groups randomly assigned to one of four different nudge treatments. Each nudge was designed to spur one of three targeted collaborative processes (collaborator skill use, effective task strategy, and the level of collective effort) demonstrated to enhance collective intelligence in extant research. Our results support the basic notion that digitally nudging collaborative processes can improve collective intelligence. However, to our surprise, a couple of nudges had unintended negative effects and ultimately decreased collective intelligence. We discuss our results using structured speculation to systematically consider the conditions under which we would or would not expect the same patterns to materialize in order to clearly articulate directions for future research.",,

Social media influencers weave sponsored posts with organic content into their feeds, which raises concerns among regulators and consumer advocates that users may not be able to clearly distinguish between sponsored and organic influencer content. Thus, regulators often mandate the explicit disclosure of sponsored content. However, there is little empirical evidence based on field data about the effects of explicit sponsorship disclosure. Therefore, we empirically investigate the effects of explicitly disclosing sponsorship in influencers’ content on users’ engagement using a large-scale field dataset collected from Facebook and Instagram. Our empirical results suggest that explicit sponsorship disclosure increases user awareness of the advertising nature and earns users’ favorability by enhancing transparency about the sponsored content. We further designed two online experiments to corroborate our empirical results and directly test the underlying mechanisms. Our findings have novel and important implications for marketers, influencers, social media platforms, and regulators in the influencer marketing industry.",,

ESM provides a rich set of affordances for organizational knowledge work, such as improved organizational memory, but also constrains knowledge work performance because of digital interruptions. Extending and complementing existing scholarship, this study asks the following research question: How can organizations design ESM to realize its knowledge work benefits? Using a computational agent-based model that incorporates the design features of ESM, workers’ attitudes, and resulting ESM-use affordances and constraints, this study shows how ESM-use outcomes are contingent both on the design of and users’ attitudes toward ESM. Specifically, the negative effects of ESM interactivity are mitigated when employees have a low transparency preference and access ESM without posting as much. The study further unpacks asymmetric engagement as the mechanism that leads low transparency configurations to be more resilient to the negative effects of interruptions driven by ESM interactivity. Asymmetric engagement—learning from posted content without interacting often—enables the gradual creation of organizational memory while maintaining a broad user base by minimizing interruptions. These results ultimately contribute a multilevel model of ESM use and knowledge work outcomes, enhancing the theoretical understanding of previously studied mechanisms such as communication visibility and providing implications for organizations designing ESM.",,

We propose that platforms could implement mechanisms such as rewards or punishments at individual or group levels to incentivize real-effort and output. We apply our interventions using a collaborative image tagging experiment—a folksonomy—and the results provide interesting insights and nonobvious consequences. On average, interventions applied at the group level outperformed interventions applied at the individual level. Punishing the group provided the most controversial incentive strategy and provided a nonobvious significant improvement in effort. Rewarding or sanctioning an individual had similar effects on average, with both treatments leading to significant increases in effort post-intervention. In contrast to predictions, sanctioning appears to have significantly motivated those that were punished.

Results showed that brain state switching was more likely during a long delay than during a short delay. Brain state switching was also more likely at the beginning of a task following a long delay than following a short delay. The default-mode network (brain regions associated with inattention) was more active during long delays than when users were engaged in the task. Furthermore, long delays were significantly related to worsened performance as measured in decision time in the task following a delay.

We analyze how the conditions of digital inequality underlying the digital marginalization of these communities affect their sensemaking as they participate in RE activities. We conceptualize these challenges as limitations on the emergence of technology affordances. Our findings reveal various shifts, or translations, in the emerging affordances, which enabled the RE activities to be more generative and consequently more inclusive.

Alec and D'Arcy, John and Benlian, Alexander",95--136,"Many of the theories used in behavioral cybersecurity research have been applied with a nomothetic approach, which is characterized by cross-sectional data (e.g., one-time surveys) that identify patterns across a population of individuals. Although this can provide valuable between-person, point-in-time insights (e.g., employees who use neutralization techniques, such as denying responsibility for cybersecurity policy violations, tend to comply less), it is unable to reveal within-person patterns that account for varying experiences and situations over time. This paper articulates why an idiographic approach, which undertakes a within-person analysis of longitudinal data, can: (1) help validate widely used theories in behavioral cybersecurity research that imply patterns of behavior within a given person over time and (2) provide distinct theoretical insights on behavioral cybersecurity phenomena by accounting for such within-person patterns. To these ends, we apply an idiographic approach to an established theory in behavioral cybersecurity research—neutralization theory—and empirically test a within-person variant of this theory using a four-week experience sampling study. Our results support a more granular application of neutralization theory in the cybersecurity context that considers the behavior of a given person over time. We conclude the paper by highlighting the contexts and theories that provide the most promising opportunities for future behavioral cybersecurity research using an idiographic approach.",,

We conducted an abductive, computationally intensive study of eight OSS projects, using relational event modeling to analyze 1,169,489 actions covering 93 major software releases. The process of entrainment that we identify involves three task allocation mechanisms: (1) developer-issue inertia, (2) developer contribution frequency, and (3) issue popularity. Our analysis demonstrates that these mechanisms and the phases of the release cycle entrain each other. Before a major release, developers engage in a concentrated mobilization phase, whereby they democratize development activity and increasingly allocate community contributions to the set of issues related to the release. After a major release, the extended cleanup phase garners a greater share of development work from recently highly active developers and dilutes the activity of these developers across a wider range of issues. Our theorizing suggests that major releases constitute important events around which OSS communities self-organize and we characterize how this occurs. Our research contributes to theorizing on organizing in OSS communities by explaining how self-organizing task allocation interacts with release cycles through the mechanism of entrainment. We also contribute to the literature on entrainment by showing how it may unfold in the context of online peer production communities such as OSS.",,

Drawing upon the theoretically driven consumer-company identification perspective, we propose that three website localization strategies (web similarity strategy, web distinctiveness strategy, and web prestige strategy) have positive effects on local users’ perceived website localization, which, in turn, is related to local users’ website loyalty. We further investigate the effects of these website localization strategies in a cross-cultural setting, focusing on the individualism-collectivism dimension of culture. Based on our online experiments in both the United States and China, we find that these website localization strategies have significant impacts on consumers’ perceived website localization, which is related to consumers’ website loyalty. We also find that web distinctiveness and web prestige strategies are more effective for people from collectivistic societies than for those from individualistic societies, whereas web similarity strategies do not differ across societal types. These findings highlight the importance of website localization strategies for customizing websites for global e-commerce.",,

However, user growth does not necessarily imply strong user stickiness. Without user stickiness, strong network effects in the current period may fade in future periods, thus rendering a user growth strategy ineffective. By adding a time dimension to network effects, we developed a model of cross-period and within-period network effects to explain how different types of network effects drive value. We emphasize that the cross-period same-side network effect contributes to user stickiness, while the within-period cross-side network effect persists conditional on user stickiness. We propose that one reason for platforms having heterogeneous cross-period same-side network effects is because of the “product learning” mechanism: it is expected that products with higher uncertainty have a stronger cross-period same-side network effect. Based on different drivers, we extend the customer lifetime value model (CLV2) to two-sided platform markets, allowing us to measure how different interventions drive platform value. Using Groupon data, we verify our insights and discuss platform design choices that enhance user stickiness when the cross-period same-side network effect is weak.",,

On the other hand, many prefer algorithmic over human advice, an effect of algorithm appreciation. However, currently, we lack a shared understanding of these constructs’ meaning and measurements, resulting in a lack of theoretical integration of empirical findings. Thus, in this research note, we conceptualize algorithm aversion as the preference for humans over algorithms in decision-making and analyze approaches in current research to measure this preference. First, we outline the implications of focusing on a specific understanding of algorithms as computational procedures or as embedded in material or nonmaterial objects. Then, we classify four decision configurations that distinguish individuals’ evaluations of algorithms, human advisors, their own judgments, or combinations of these. Consequently, we develop a classification scheme that provides guidance for future research to develop more specific hypotheses on the direction of preferences (aversion vs. appreciation) and the effect of moderators.",,

These theories do not account for the social injustice that occurs through the lack of recognition of individuals when data are first conceptualized. We explore the recognition of individuals in data conceptualization by drawing from information systems (IS) literature on data artifacts that acknowledges the fact that data are comprised of semantics and formats. Guided by recognition theory, we studied a project to expand sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection at a public, U.S.-based LGBTQ+ welcoming university. We found that while the actors involved worked towards recognizing in SOGI data the fact that identities are layered, non-binary, plural, and fluid, the data themselves still misrecognized individuals due to data warping. We argue that data warping occurs because of recognition concessions between social recognition through data semantics and systems recognition through data formats. Such concessions are both necessary for some recognition but accessory to misrecognition. Our findings have implications for recognition theory, data justice, and information systems research, as well as for personal data in practice.",,

We also study the relationship between the ES standardization and ES extensiveness of the acquiring and target firms and M&A offer premiums. The empirical analysis suggests that the ES standardization of acquirers is related to lower offer premiums and a higher market response to the acquisition for the acquirer. However, it is the ES extensiveness of the acquirer that improves long-term performance i.e., decreases goodwill impairment and increases operating performance. The analysis also indicates that the target’s ES standardization increases the premium for the target firm and generates a positive market response to the acquisition for the target firm. Overall, the analysis indicates that the ES standardization likely affects the integration cost that influences market response to the M&A and to the M&A premium in the short term, but it is ES extensiveness that affects the realized synergy from the M&A that affects long-term performance.",,

We use fixed effects and matching techniques to control for endogeneity in commentary and consumer disclosure, while embedding a new text-based model of product similarity into our econometric analysis and capturing product complementarity using network-based measures of similarity. Our findings demonstrate that disclosed purchase patterns are shaped by other users, even those with whom the discloser has no previously stated relationship. We find that the source of attention shapes disclosure behavior, and we uncover a relationship between comments and purchase similarity of disclosed purchases, suggesting that consumers play to the crowd. The negative relationship between product reviews and purchase disclosure suggest that consumers may disclose a purchase because of a relationship with that particular item and not a desire to habitually reveal purchases.

Therefore, it is legitimate to ask: Are our theory borrowing practices hampering our ability to grapple with revolutionary developments in IS, and if so, what can be done? Through an investigation of the field’s borrowing of transaction cost economics theory, we find extant IS research largely (1) borrows for theory testing within the IS context, (2) develops models that uninspiringly reflect the borrowed theory, and (3) treats the IS as an exogenous actor. In this article, we propose an alternative approach to theory borrowing, inspired by conceptual blending theory. Our approach focuses on the structural nature of IS phenomena and borrowed theories. Such a structure-based approach can reveal correspondence between IS phenomena and unexpected reference theories while also highlighting discrepancies that serve as an opportunity for novel integrations of an information system into the reference theory.

To repair the potential damage to relationships with stakeholders after data breaches, companies adopt a variety of response strategies. However, the effects of these response strategies on the behavior of stakeholders after a data breach are unclear; differences in response times may also affect these outcomes, depending on the notification laws that apply to each company. As part of a multimethod study, we first identified the adopted response strategies in Study 1 based on content analysis of the response letters issued by publicly traded U.S. companies (n = 204) following data breaches; these strategies include any combination of the following: corrective action, apology, and compensation. We also found that breached companies may remain silent and adopt a “no action” strategy. In Studies 2 and 3, we examined the effects of various response strategies and response times on the predominant stakeholders affected by data breaches: customers and investors. In Study 2, we focused on customers and present a moderated-moderated-mediation model based on the expectancy violation theory. To test this model, we designed a factorial survey with 15 different conditions (n = 811). In Study 3, we focused on investors and conducted an event study (n = 166) to examine their reactions to company responses to data breaches. The results indicate the presence of moderating effects of certain response strategies; surprisingly, we did not find compensation to be more effective than apology. The magnitude of the moderating effects of response strategies is contingent upon response time. We also found that the negative effects of data breaches disappear after six months.

The newcomers are 10% more likely to post another deal, suggesting an increase in retention. However, we do not observe any effect of the intervention on the quality of subsequent contributions.

They allow product managers to use data driven decision-making through online controlled experiments that estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) relative to a status quo control setting and make associated inferences. As demand for experiments continues to grow, orthogonal test planes (OTPs) have become the industry standard for managing the assignment of users to multiple concurrent experimental treatments in companies using large-scale digital experimentation platforms. In recent years, firms have begun to recognize that test planes might be confounding experimental results, but nevertheless, the practical benefits outweigh the costs. However, the uptick in practitioner-led digital experiments has coincided with an increase in academic-industry research partnerships, where large-scale digital experiments are being used to scientifically answer research questions, validate design choices, and/or to derive computational social science-based empirical insights. In such contexts, confounding and biased estimation may have much more pronounced implications for the validity of scientific findings, contributions to theory, building a cumulative literature, and ultimately practice. The purpose of this issues and opinions (I&O) article is to shed light on OTPs – in our experience, most researchers are unaware how such test planes can lead to incorrect inferences. We use a case study conducted at a major e-commerce company to illustrate the extent to which interactions in concurrent experiments can bias ATEs, often making them appear more positive than they actually are. We discuss implications for research, including the distinction between practical industry experiments and academic research, methodological best practices for mitigating such concerns, and transparency and reproducibility considerations stemming from the complexity and opacity of large-scale experimentation platforms. More broadly, we worry that confounding in scientific research due to reliance on large-scale digital experiments, meant to serve a different purpose, is a microcosm of a larger epistemological confounding regarding what constitutes a contribution to scientific knowledge.",,

However, a novel theoretical lens is needed to comprehend funders’ enthusiasm in their support of such campaigns. Building on the extant literature on contagion effect, we constructed a research model that posits confidence contagion invoked by confidence cues embedded in campaign materials as a key driver of overfunding. Our hypotheses were validated in two complementary empirical studies. In Study 1, we manipulated confidence cues in a controlled experiment to verify the activation of confidence contagion at the individual level. Analytical results indicate that individual funders detect self-confidence traits from confidence cues embedded in campaign materials and assimilate the fundraiser’s confidence via a spontaneous social appraisal mechanism. In turn, confidence contagion drives funders to congregate and invest in campaigns. In Study 2, we analyzed a secondary dataset collected from a leading equity crowdfunding platform to discern how confidence contagion drives overfunding at the collective level. By modeling funding activities as a Hawkes process, we derived three key metrics that govern the emergence and magnitude of funding surges. We demonstrated that these metrics of funding surges mediate the impact of confidence cues on the level of overfunding for equity crowdfunding campaigns. The findings from this study could inform future research seeking to untangle the interdependencies between individual and collective mechanisms underlying crowd phenomena, provide strategic guidance to fundraisers interested in promoting the overfunding of their campaigns, and help crowdfunding platforms predict the potential extent of overfunding and advise fundraisers accordingly.",,

In addition to embracing a proprietary or fully open source strategy, several firms choose a partial openness strategy wherein only certain parts of the code are open source while the rest is proprietary. Specifically, when adopting a partial openness strategy, a firm may choose to make the core software code open source while keeping the extension software code proprietary or keep the core proprietary and make the extension open source. When making decisions related to different openness strategies, firms need to take into account the level of effort they are exerting toward the improvement of the quality of software, the level of engagement of the open source community, and pricing. Hence, the decisions related to a firm’s openness strategy are not straightforward. While this is an important question for many firms, it has not been analyzed in the literature. In this research, we attempt to fill this important gap by analyzing different openness strategies in the context of resource allocation for fixing defects. Specifically, using a game-theoretic model, we explore when a firm should make its software fully open source or partially open source and when it should keep it proprietary. Our results show that when the baseline demand for the firm increases with the extent of openness, the firm should either make its software fully open or keep it proprietary and, importantly, should not rely on partial openness. Next, in scenarios where customers are highly sensitive to security risks, the demand loss to efficiency gain ratio has an important role in determining a firm’s optimal openness strategies.

In two fMRI experiments, we test this theory by comparing brain activation during a graphic comprehension task using two different graph types: bubble graphs and three-dimensional surface graphs. In accordance with our hypotheses, we find that comprehension of three-dimensional surface graphs results in greater activation of the ventral stream and greater accuracy in graphical comprehension than bubble graphs. We argue that this is because the human visual system is evolutionarily adapted to the comprehension of three-dimensional surfaces. The implication is that choosing graphical representations that match what the brain is evolutionarily specialized to process can enhance graphic comprehension.",,

We assess the relative efficacy of these two outsourcing modes by identifying the effects of three factors: task modularity, the extent of alignment between a (verifiable) performance metric and project revenue, and the extent to which project revenue is itself verifiable. We find that if tasks are modular then multisourcing strictly dominates single-sourcing—provided the verifiable performance metric and project revenue are not completely aligned. Yet if tasks are integrated, then the choice of sourcing mode is more nuanced: the best choice depends on trade-offs among the alignment between performance metric and project revenue, the verifiability of project revenue, and moral hazard. If the verifiable performance metric and project revenue are perfectly aligned, or if project revenue is completely verifiable, then firms prefer single-sourcing because it entails less moral hazard than does multisourcing. Comparative statistics for the effects of task interdependence costs and vendors’ risk aversion reveal that multisourcing (single-sourcing) should be preferred when there are interdependence costs (/when vendors are strongly risk averse).",,

Integrating the emerging literature on social media and crowdfunding with the literature on social networks and public goods, we theorize that prosocially, public-oriented crowdfunding campaigns will benefit disproportionately from social media activity when advocates’ social media networks exhibit greater levels of embeddedness. Drawing on a panel dataset that combines campaign fundraising activity associated with more than 1,000 campaigns on Kickstarter with campaign-related social media activity on Twitter, we construct network-level measures of embeddedness between and amongst individuals initiating the latter, in terms of transitivity and topological overlap. We demonstrate that Twitter activity drives a disproportionate increase in fundraising for prosocially oriented crowdfunding campaigns when posting users’ networks exhibit greater embeddedness. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, highlighting how our work extends prior research on the role of embeddedness in peer influence by demonstrating the joint roles of message features and network structure in the peer influence process. Our work suggests that when a transmitter’s message is prosocial or cause-oriented, embeddedness will play a stronger role in determining influence. We also discuss the broader theoretical implications for the literatures on social media, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and private contributions to public goods. Finally, we highlight the practical implications for marketers, campaign organizers, and crowdfunding platform operators.",,

Thus, a potential source of resistance to adopting a new system lies in the use of an incumbent system. Using the status quo bias and habit literatures as theoretical lenses, the study explains how use of an incumbent system negatively impacts new system perceptions and usage intentions. We argue that habitual use of an incumbent system, rationalization due to perceived transition costs, and psychological commitment due to perceived sunk costs all encourage development of inertia. Inertia in turn fully mediates the impact of these incumbent system constructs on constructs related to acceptance of the new system via psychological commitment based on cognitive consistency and by increasing the importance of normative pressures. Specifically, we hypothesize that inertia leads to decreased perceptions of the ease of use and relative advantage of a newly introduced system and has a negative impact on intentions to use the new system, above and beyond its impact through perceptions. Finally, we hypothesize that inertia moderates the relationship between subjective norm and intention, such that normative pressures to use a new system become more important in the presence of inertia. Empirical results largely support the hypothesized relationships showing the inhibiting effect of incumbent-system habit, transition and sunk costs, and inertia on acceptance of a new system. Our study thus extends theoretical understanding of the role of incumbent system constructs such as habit and inertia in technology acceptance, and lays the foundations for further study of the interplay between perceptions and cognition with respect to the incumbent system and those with respect to a new system.",,

Following the design science paradigm, this study chooses cognitive load theory as the kernel theory and proposes a new interleaving design—related-interleaving —that populates an interleaved session with related topics as a way of reducing cognitive load during an interleaved session. Drawing on the theoretical predictions, we design and instantiate a personalized learning system with the related-interleaving strategy by fusing educational strategies and machine learning techniques. The results from a two-month field experiment confirm that related-interleaving outperforms non-interleaving and unrelated-interleaving. Our findings also reveal that compared with unrelated-interleaving, related-interleaving benefits weak learners more and thus helps reduce learning performance disparities. This study demonstrates how personalized e-learning systems can be further improved from the perspective of interleaving.",,

Specifically, biases induced by observing personalized system recommendations can lead to distortions in users’ self-reported preference ratings after consumption of an item, thus contaminating the users’ subsequent inputs to the recommender system. This, in turn, provides the system with an inaccurate view of user preferences and opens up possibilities of rating manipulation. As recommender systems continue to become increasingly popular in today’s online environments, preventing or reducing such system-induced biases constitutes a highly important and practical research problem. In this paper, we address this problem via the analysis of different rating display designs for the purpose of proactively preventing biases before they occur (i.e., at rating collection time). We use randomized laboratory experimentation to test how the presentation format of personalized recommendations affects the biases generated in post-consumption preference ratings. We demonstrate that graphical rating display designs of recommender systems are more advantageous than numerical designs in reducing the biases, although none are able to remove biases completely. We also show that scale compatibility is a contributing mechanism operating to create these biases, although not the only one. Together, the results have practical implications for the design and implementation of recommender systems as well as theoretical implications for the study of recommendation biases.",,

Various challenges in the age of big data, such as high volume and high velocity, call for efficient database maintenance policies. This study focuses on deriving an optimal synchronization policy for consolidated database systems. By trading off synchronization cost with data staleness cost, we propose a time-based dynamic synchronization (TDS) policy, which evaluates the system state at predetermined checkpoints and synchronizes a consolidated database system only if given staleness thresholds are crossed. Although several database synchronization and knowledge refreshment policies have been proposed in the prior literature, the TDS policy retains their advantages and overcomes their inflexibility in that, under the TDS policy, system check and synchronization are easy to schedule, disruptions to business operations can be avoided, and synchronization is run only if necessary. Experimental results show that the TDS policy consistently outperforms benchmark policies, leading to substantial cost savings. In particular, the performance gap between the TDS policy and a static periodic policy is greater when data changes arrive less frequently but carry higher unit staleness costs, or when queries arrive more frequently and suffer higher unit staleness costs.",,

In this paper, we employ a mixed-methods design using data from the geodata platform OpenStreetMap to develop and test two distinct types of platform signals as a means of implementing a platform operator’s strategy: (1) opportunity signals, which aim to stimulate activity in new areas of the platform, and (2) endorsement signals, which aim to increase activity in existing areas of the platform. In particular, we examine how platform signals influence the generation of platform content in terms of the volume and diversity of information on the platform.

Our analysis yields two main findings. First, an environment-focused green IT organizational strategy has a stronger positive moderating effect than a cost-focused green IT organizational strategy on the association between green IT standards and sustainability-monitoring capability. Similarly, an environment-focused green IT organizational strategy has a stronger positive moderating effect than a cost-focused green IT organizational strategy on the association between green IT standards and financial profit.

This causes a tension between the cognitive limitations of individuals and their access to large volumes of information. This tension is important not only for individuals but also for teams, which are increasingly making important organizational decisions. Recognizing this tension, this paper investigates the relationship between information volume and decision performance in IS-enabled teams. We use information processing and schema theories to develop a contextualized theoretical model, wherein information volume has a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) effect on decision performance, and this effect is moderated by three context-relevant attributes of the team members: computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, and learning goal orientation. We conducted two complementary studies, with similar experimental contexts and procedures but different types of participants and different tasks. In these studies, 236 individuals in 118 dyads (Study 1) and 200 individuals in 60 small teams (Study 2) made decisions over time using an enterprise resource planning system for a competitive virtual firm in a business simulation. We used objective data on system use and decision outcomes, along with survey data, to test the theoretical model. The two complementary studies find consistent results supporting the curvilinear relationship between information volume and decision performance and find that this relationship is flattened by high computer self-efficacy. Study 1 also supports the hypothesized steepening effects of high computer anxiety and learning goal orientation on the curvilinear relationship. Study 2 does not support these effects of computer anxiety and learning goal orientation but highlights some boundary conditions for them. Together, the studies provide insights into how information volume affects decision performance in IS-enabled teams, and how context-relevant team member attributes moderate this relationship and themselves affect decision performance.",,

This paper explores such interactions through the lens of delegation by investigating how many algorithms delegate to many humans in a multi-agent setting. Analyzing patent data and interviews with drivers and passengers, we unpack delegation in the context of the ride-hailing application Uber. We theorize distributed delegation as a construct capturing collective hybrid appraisal, collective hybrid distribution, and collective hybrid coordination, in which a collective of algorithms delegates by drawing on inputs from multiple human agents. Our findings highlight that distributed delegation is collective, hybrid, and relational by nature, and demonstrate the extent to which human inputs are necessary for collectives of algorithms to exercise the capacity to delegate. Distributed delegation as a continuum of algorithmic and human involvement poses a challenge for recent theories suggesting the unprecedented autonomy of algorithms from humans.",,

We put forth that while EHR adoption reduces the likelihood of claim denials by improving the accuracy and completeness of information processing, it can also increase claim denials if EHR applications are sourced from multiple vendors within a hospital or different vendors across hospitals. With a large-scale dataset of claim records from the State of Maryland in 2012-2016, we find that the greater EHR adoption by care providers, the less likely a claim is denied. In addition, EHRs are more effective in preventing denials when a hospital sources EHR applications from a single vendor and when a group of hospitals in the same health system sources EHRs from the same vendor. Additionally, we observe a decrease in claim denials when physicians have previously worked in hospitals utilizing EHR applications from the same vendor. This study provides significant theoretical insights into the information systems literature on HIT and offers practical implications for healthcare providers by uncovering the multi-faceted roles of EHRs in information processing and compliance.",,

After developing and validating a scale to measure technological entitlement, we conduct three studies with working adult samples to test our hypotheses.

Its emergence from the individual to the unit level is shaped by different configurations of task, user, and system interdependence between instances of individual-level IS use.

Using a propensity score matching technique combined with a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, our study shows that the impact of meaningful-use attestation is contingent on the nature of data breaches and the time frame.

Field experiments on a learning management system show that providing descriptive information about peers’ behavior has mixed effects in reducing procrastination and improving performance outcomes. Specifically, the effects are moderated by individual characteristics and contextual variables. First, peer information interventions are more effective for males, and the effects are stronger in a male-majority environment than in a female-majority environment. These findings differ from prior studies of social-norms interventions conducted in noncompetitive settings, in which females are found to be more responsive to interventions. Gender differences in our competitive settings can be explained by males’ and females’ differential preferences for competition: males are more competitive-oriented and thus are more responsive to peer information in competitive environments. Second, we find that individuals who are in great need of interventions, that is, those with poor past behavior and performance, are also more likely to benefit from peer information interventions, suggesting that peer information interventions motivate positive change.

In addition, to the best of our knowledge, information systems (IS) research thus far has not considered how the decision-making authority of an IT unit influences IT project performance at the organizational level. We leverage several unique characteristics of the public sector, vis-à-vis for-profit firms, in developing our theory and hypothesis. Utilizing official datasets on IT projects and human resource records, we find that the more IT managerial officials and supervisors a federal bureau has, the lower time overruns it experiences in its IT projects. Interestingly, this relationship is weakened when the bureau has a larger number of ongoing IT projects. Our findings offer new theoretical insights for the IT project management literature and provide meaningful policy insights into government IT management.",,

They are behind the emergence of IT offerings such as cloud computing and converged networks, and manifest themselves through two important trends: (1) lower the cost of sharing a common infrastructure across multiple services with disparate resource requirements, and (2) dynamic provisioning of capacity in response to demand. Conventional wisdom is that both of these capabilities are synergistic, with greater provisioning flexibility improving the benefits derived from sharing computing or network resources. Consequently, a service operator should now always favor the use of a shared infrastructure over dedicated solutions when hosting multiple services. In this paper, we ask whether this is indeed the case, and investigate the dual impact of lower costs of sharing and provisioning flexibility on shared and dedicated infrastructures. The investigation reveals that while lower costs are always expected to favor infrastructure sharing, dynamic provisioning plays an ambiguous role. Reprovisioning improves both shared and dedicated solutions, but can do so differently and can sometimes favor a dedicated infrastructure. Our findings help illustrate that the technology trends, such as virtualization, behind cloud computing need not always favor the deployment of services on a shared infrastructure.",,

The Case of IT-Enabled Platform Markets,"Feng, Haiyang and Jiang, Zhengrui and Li, Minqiang and Feng, Nan",1107--1141,"Information technology-enabled platforms are playing an increasingly important role in the global economy. While some successful platforms entered their respective markets as pioneers, others were able to achieve market dominance despite starting as followers. This study investigates the conditions under which first-mover advantage (FMA) or second-mover advantage (SMA) occurs in a platform market, and derives their equilibrium order of market entries and optimal market entry timing. The first three determinants of FMA and SMA we identify are (1) quality improvement rate of the second mover, (2) length of demand window, and (3) length of market growth phase of demand window. When the two companies’ order of market entries is predetermined, the second mover having a higher initial platform quality than the first mover guarantees SMA, whereas the first mover having a higher initial platform quality than the second mover does not ensure FMA. In the latter case, the three determinants are needed to determine FMA and SMA. When the two companies’ order of market entries is endogenous, if any of the three determinants is sufficiently small, preemptive entry, in which both companies prefer to move early, is the equilibrium; otherwise, sequential entry, in which one company prefers to move early and the other prefers to move late, becomes the equilibrium in most cases. We also find that strong (same-side) network effects can weaken SMA and increase the possibility that both companies prefer early market entry, whereas strong cross-side network effects may strengthen SMA and increase the possibility that both companies prefer late market entry.",,

Yet they are largely underexplored in current false news detection research, especially in terms of how to efficiently utilize such information. We observe that the crowd contributes to the challenging task of assessing the veracity of news by posting responses or reporting. We propose combining these two types of scalable crowd judgments with machine intelligence to tackle the false news crisis. Specifically, we design a novel framework called CAND, which first extracts relevant human and machine judgments from data sources including news features and scalable crowd intelligence. The extracted information is then aggregated by an unsupervised Bayesian aggregation model. Evaluation based on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of crowd intelligence and the superior performance of the proposed framework in comparison with the benchmark methods. The results also generate many valuable insights, such as the complementary value of human and machine intelligence, the possibility of using human intelligence for early detection, and the robustness of our approach to intentional manipulation. This research significantly contributes to relevant literature on false news detection and crowd intelligence. In practice, our proposed framework serves as a feasible and effective approach for false news detection.",,

This study investigates how this last-mile infrastructure may serve as an offline platform to connect customers and merchants in the physical world by leveraging walk-in traffic (organic interaction) and prompting interested customers through online intervention (induced interaction). Using free sample distribution as an example, we designed two large-scale studies in collaboration with Alibaba—an observational study across 1,032 stations and a randomized field experiment among 189,019 customers—to examine the causal effects of organic and induced interactions on customers’ subsequent online purchases from the focal brands, respectively. We found that induced interaction drives significantly more online sales than organic interaction. Under induced interaction, the online intervention effectively increases the number of free samples distributed. Nevertheless, the more significant increase in online sales for induced claimers is not simply due to more free samples distributed but because the induced customers are more interested and more likely to purchase. We identified this phenomenon as a screening mechanism that facilitates an advantageous selection of customers claiming the samples. Customers willing to pay the additional travel cost to claim samples are more likely to purchase the focal brands afterward. Finally, we developed a customized targeting framework using a generalized random forest model to enhance the effectiveness of induced interaction at the last-mile stations. Our study raises a key insight that the “foot-in-the-door” traffic in an omnichannel environment can be fundamentally different depending on whether the offline customers are driven from the online channel.",,

Using platform-level analysis, we show that opening the platform shifted demand toward the head of the distribution: More funds and backers became concentrated in a smaller number of head-offers (the superstar effect). Using individual backer-level analysis, we show that these changes in demand distribution are likely to have resulted from changes in investors’ investment behavior, beyond changes in the composition of the demand side (that is, changes in the types of investors entering the market). Together, our results suggest that efforts to level the playing field in crowdfunding platforms can ultimately result in a less equitable distribution of funds across market participants, and drive investors to focus their investments on a smaller set of campaigns.",,

We test our hypotheses in four studies.

Study 2 manipulates usability and shows similar markers of attentional interference in MME on a website with two different populations.

The results consistently show that MME can help identify usability differences among parts of systems.

However, there is considerable heterogeneity among hotels in response to Airbnb competition.

This study focuses on the project’s form of coordination—the way in which interdependent contributions are managed—as a driving force behind propagation costs. It distinguishes between two coordination archetypes. First, artifact-based coordination is found in egalitarian projects, in which developers only use the work artifact (the architecture itself), without direct interaction, to coordinate. Second, authority-based coordination is used in hierarchical projects (e.g., Linux Kernel) or when companies pay developers for their work. Using a computational model, this study compares these two coordination mechanisms by simulating how they build software architectures (formalized as design structure matrices) from interdependent contributions. As a contextual condition, the model considers the degree of architecture visibility, which is the developers’ (in)ability to see recent additions to the architecture. The model provides two insights. First, artifact-based coordination, as compared to authority-based coordination, generally leads to lower propagation costs. Second, decreasing the degree of architecture visibility reduces propagation costs, an effect that I describe as focal-layered superposition. These insights contribute to the literatures on coordination in OSS development and the mirroring hypothesis. They also have practical implications for the creation of preferable architectures in OSS development.",,

A high concentration of property use, our analyses reveal, can enhance the effectiveness of deterrence created through enforcement action against noise complaints. We further conduct empirically informed simulation experiments and propose a nudging algorithm which helps platforms mitigate noise externalities while also fulfilling user preferences and maintaining revenue growth.

In these attacks, the adversary deliberately manipulates a malicious input by taking a sequence of actions so that a targeted cyber defense AI agent fails to correctly determine its maliciousness. Consequently, the robustness of cyber defense AI agents has raised deep concerns in modern cyber defense. Drawing on the computational design science paradigm, we couple robust optimization and reinforcement learning theories to develop a novel framework, called Reinforcement Learning-based Adversarial Attack Robustness (RADAR), to increase the robustness of cyber defense AI agents against adversarial attacks. To demonstrate practical utility, we instantiate RADAR for malware attacks – the primary cause of financial loss in cyber attacks. We rigorously evaluate the performance of RADAR as a situated IT artifact against state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning-based benchmark methods. Incorporating RADAR in three renowned malware detectors shows an adversarial robustness increase of up to seven times, on average.

We examine the effects of such technology-mediated work-related interruptions that occur during one’s time off on both work and nonwork outcomes. Leveraging theoretical perspectives from interruption, work–life interface, and conservation of resources, we conceptualize both positive and negative effects of such interruptions on behavioral and psychological outcomes. We identify three mediating mechanisms via which these effects occur: interruption overload and psychological transition via which negative effects occur and task closure via which positive effects occur. Results reveal significant effects of interruptions on work and nonwork outcomes through the three mediating mechanisms. Although positive effects are observed, the total effects of work-related interruptions are detrimental across both work and nonwork outcomes, with the strongest negative effect on work exhaustion. The results suggest that after-hours work interruptions do not necessarily benefit work performance and come at the cost of work exhaustion. Analyses also reveal that the effects of interruptions are dependent on the technology via which these occur.

Alongside this empowerment, safety concerns over unregulated drivers for transportation network company (TNC) platforms such as Uber and Lyft have led to discourse among policymakers on the necessity of background check laws (BCLs) with different stringency to exclude individuals from TNC jobs. Drawing on theories of labeling, routine activity, and rational choice theory, we conceptualize a trilogy of guardians—the government, TNC platforms, and the community—to safeguard ridesharing while mitigating the social costs of excluding marginalized citizens from TNC jobs. Empirically, we document the shifting of crimes into the property domain as an unintended consequence of the exclusion solution (i.e., BCLs by the government). Our findings indicate that digital safety technologies deployed by TNC platforms to deter crimes (i.e., in-app safety features) can serve as an alternative to BCLs. Moreover, we show that resources provided by the community can inhibit the negative impacts of exclusion by stringent BCL (i.e., through alternative income sources) and enable the effectiveness of deterrence by in-app safety features (i.e., through policing). Our study surfaces a holistic social justice assessment that involves examining the risks of excluding marginalized individuals from gig work and showing that digital technologies expand the solution space to achieve the public safety of citizens and inclusivity in gig employment through enabling the role of each guardian as well as their interdependence.",,

The Role of Regional and Caste Spillovers from Computer Ownership,"Liu, Che-Wei and Mithas, Sunil and Saldanha, Terence J.",1423--1452,"How do technology resources such as computer ownership help create opportunity equality and facilitate income mobility? This is an important question because opportunity constraint, or the lack of opportunity equality, often manifests in low income mobility in many countries. This study addresses this question by examining the spillover effects of computer ownership of households in terms of household income mobility considering spatial proximity and social proximity. Drawing on knowledge spillovers theory, we hypothesize that households experience upward income mobility due to increased computer ownership among households in spatial proximity. Further, drawing on social capital theory, we hypothesize that households experience higher upward mobility due to increased computer ownership among households in the region that are socially proximate or in the same caste. Our empirical analysis of data from over 32,000 households across all states in India from two waves (2005 and 2011) of the Indian Human Development Survey supports our hypotheses. Our exploratory analyses suggest that households in regions with high social harmony experience higher upward income mobility from increased computer ownership among households in the region. We also found that increased computer ownership among households in the region helps households belonging to disadvantaged castes overcome low income mobility. Overall, the study shows how the returns to computer ownership in terms of household upward income mobility go beyond private returns, and spill over to other households in spatial proximity, particularly to those belonging to the same caste. A key implication for policymakers is to use twin levers of social harmony and technology resources to create opportunity equality to facilitate income mobility, instead of focusing solely on technology resources.",,

Such a “win–win–win” situation is not only good for the supply chain, but is also beneficial for the overall economy. The economic rationale for this surprising result is rooted in how piracy interacts with double marginalization. We explain this rationale and develop useful insights for management and policy.",,

Taking a designing view, we trace how six independent digital ventures in the German financial services industry dealt with this tension as they created their digital market offerings. Our findings suggest that digital ventures enact three designing mechanisms to resolve the tension: bounding the technology scope, transposing through digital objects, and probing the solution space. Through these mechanisms, digital ventures construct a buffer—one that has functional, material, and temporal dimensions—between the vision they gradually realize through their market offering and the here-and-now conditions of the environment that digital ventures enter.",,

In this paper, we discuss and test three alternative models underlying user comparison of competing systems: separate, crossover effect, and relative comparison processes. The separate comparison process proposes that users develop separate cognitive, affective, and conative evaluations toward each system, and the between-system comparison only occurs at the point of choosing a preferred system. The crossover effect comparison process posits that users not only perform separate evaluations for each system, but also consider the competitive effects when proceeding across cognitive, affective, and conative evaluation stages. In contrast, the relative comparison process postulates that users directly compare competing systems within each of the cognitive, affective, and conative evaluation stages. Based on the IS continuance model, we tested each of these three models using data collected from users of two competing instant messaging systems.

We explore an assumption of research and practice: that a platform’s architecture needs to be decoupled so that producers can easily mix and match the platform’s design elements (APIs, code libraries, process models, etc.) into apps that perform well competitively, and insulate the platform from skewed outcomes and low market performance. However, in practice, complete decoupling is not just difficult but almost impossible. Based on more than two million runs of an exploratory NK model in which producers use a platform’s design space for the creation of apps, we generate several surprising insights. First, we show that tighter coupling may not necessarily be harmful depending on the producers’ design strategies and the amount of constraints placed on design elements. Second, we observe that if moderate to tightly coupled platforms with optimizing producers focused exclusively on being competitive, platform performance is lower compared to platforms with satisficing producers who put a lower priority of being competitive because of other interests. This is surprising since optimizers are better suited to cope with the inherent uncertainty of coupling. Finally, moderately coupled platforms can outperform platforms with loose coupling when constraints nudge producers into distant design moves while also isolating them from downside uncertainty. These three findings offer implications for multiple streams of literature on platform architectures.",,

However, the literature has not analyzed whether search position can cause users to change their consumption between two ex ante distinct product categories. We analyze this question in the context of the ongoing public policy debate surrounding the role search engines can play in anti-piracy efforts. Specifically, we analyze whether reducing the prominence of infringing links can impact users choices between legal and infringing content. To do this we design a customized search engine that allows us to manipulate the positions of infringing and legal links in users’ search results. We then use this search engine to conduct experiments on a general population of users and on a subset of college-aged users. Our data show that reducing the prominence of infringing links in search results causes users who otherwise would have consumed infringing content to switch their consumption to paid legal content, and that these results hold even among users whose initial search queries express an explicit preference for infringing content. These results suggest that even small changes in the cost of discovering pirated content can have a relatively large impact on user behavior. As such, our results inform an important public policy debate by showing that search engines have a vital role to play in the fight against online copyright theft.",,

We consider two types of followers: developers (those directly involved in software development) and observers (those indirectly involved in it). We conduct a series of empirical investigations by using a longitudinal dataset of OSS projects hosted in GitHub, along with a survey and qualitative data.

The counterfactual approach we consider defines an explanation as a set of the system’s data inputs that causally drives the decision (i.e., changing the inputs in the set changes the decision) and is irreducible (i.e., changing any subset of the inputs does not change the decision). We (1) demonstrate how this framework may be used to provide explanations for decisions made by general data-driven AI systems that can incorporate features with arbitrary data types and multiple predictive models, and (2) propose a heuristic procedure to find the most useful explanations depending on the context. We then contrast counterfactual explanations with methods that explain model predictions by weighting features according to their importance (e.g., Shapley additive explanations [SHAP], local interpretable model-agnostic explanations [LIME]) and present two fundamental reasons why we should carefully consider whether importance-weight explanations are well suited to explain system decisions. Specifically, we show that (1) features with a large importance weight for a model prediction may not affect the corresponding decision, and (2) importance weights are insufficient to communicate whether and how features influence decisions. We demonstrate this with several concise examples and three detailed case studies that compare the counterfactual approach with SHAP to illustrate conditions under which counterfactual explanations explain data-driven decisions better than importance weights.",,

An Exploratory Study on Influences of Autistic Tendency and Gender in the U.S. and India,"Jia, Ronnie and Steelman, Zachary and Jia, Heather",1603--1634,"To increase diversity and inclusion in IT enrollment and employment, we must first answer the question: What makes one intrinsically interested in technology in the first place? To the extent that one’s choice of an IT education and career is driven by such intrinsic interest, the answer to this question will inform the various educational and organizational efforts to enhance social inclusion through increasing neurodiversity and gender diversity. Building on prior literature on the empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory of autism, we employ two studies to explore the influences of autistic tendency and gender on intrinsic interest in IT. In Study 1, survey data from a U.S. sample provide support for autistic tendency as an antecedent of IT interest. The data also show that after controlling for individual variations in autistic tendency, the seemingly higher IT interest exhibited by U.S. men versus women becomes nonsignificant, demonstrating autistic tendency as an underlying mechanism by which differences in IT interest manifest between men and women. In Study 2, we replicate the model with respondents from India. Survey results again provide support for autistic tendency as an antecedent of IT interest and further show that there exists no significant gender difference in IT interest in India, regardless of whether autistic tendency is controlled for. This research offers a belated academic acknowledgment of the autism-IT linkage for the IS field and a comprehensive introduction of the E-S theory as a theoretical lens for multiple areas of IS research, including social inclusion, adoption, neuroIS, and evolutionary theory building. The finding of a nonsignificant difference in IT interest between men and women in the U.S. and India dispels a gender stereotype and demonstrates that collective-level gender labels may yield misleading results when individual-level factors, such as autistic tendency, masquerade as gender differences. Implications for IS practice are also discussed.",,

It does this through an overarching theoretical framework that integrates three dominant theories of interorganizational relations in the IT outsourcing literature, namely transaction cost economics, resource dependency, and social exchange theories. A contingency fit theoretical framing is married to a configurational approach to explicate the intricate relationships that spring up between a focal firm and its outsourcing vendors when they are working toward specific strategic objectives under varying contingencies. In line with this theoretical objective, we used qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), a set-theoretic configuration method that can handle the interdependent complexity among multiple elements of IT outsourcing. The technique was applied to a sample of 235 companies that have outsourced some or all of their IT functions. Findings at the project level of analysis empirically reveal two sets of configurations of strategic IT outsourcing elements, one set of configurations resulting in high economic benefit and the other set leading to high strategic benefit. Next, we compare similarities and differences among multiple, equifinal configurations and infer archetypes of IT outsourcing strategy internally congruent in terms of the strategic objectives as well as matching specific contextual contingencies. Our holistic archetypes take the form of theoretical propositions integrating the previous fragmented and inconsistent knowledge in IT outsourcing resulting from the causal ambiguity and complexity inherent in IT outsourcing projects as well as from divergent theories in the literature. Furthermore, by defining specific contingency boundaries, our archetypes provide managers with context-specific guidelines for strategic decisions regarding their relationships with outsourcing vendors, helping different sized firms to effectively succeed in IT outsourcing, contingent on the IT type being outsourced. Finally, we discuss new insights and implications of this study for complementing and extending the extant theories in IT outsourcing.",,

Building on these categories we develop a conception of digital objects and a novel “bearer” theory of how material and nonmaterial objects combine. The role of computation is considered, and how the identity and system functions of digital objects flow from their social positioning in the communities in which they arise. Various implications of the theory are identified, focusing on its use as a conceptual frame through which to view digital phenomena, and its potential to inform existing perspectives with regard both to how digital technology per se and the relationship between people and digital technology should be theorized.

Furthermore, while much of our knowledge of technology-related stress and its effects derives from cross-sectional studies examining between-person differences, there is a need for longitudinal, daily investigations that take a within-person view. Integrating the challenge–hindrance stressor framework with affective events theory and work–home spillover literature, we propose a broader conceptualization of technology-related stressors, referred to as technology-driven (TD) stressors, which comprise technology-driven challenge (TCS) and hindrance (THS) stressors, and examine how and why daily TCS and THS experienced at work affect the relationship between employees and their partners at home. In an experience sampling study of 115 employees who responded to daily surveys both at work and at home over a two-week period, we found that while THS are negatively related to partnership satisfaction via negative affect, TCS are positively related to partnership satisfaction via positive affect. We also investigated the moderating effect of work–home role integration (WHI) and perceived organizational support in work–home boundary management (POS) on the strength of the within-individual spillover processes. Our results show that WHI acts as a double-edged sword for letting TCS- and THS-triggered positive and negative affect spill over to partnership satisfaction, whereas POS serves as a facilitator of positive affect and as a buffer against negative affect. Broadly, our study shows that understanding daily TD work stressors is important because their negative and positive downstream effects often do not stop at employees’ workplace boundaries but actually penetrate and shape their everyday lives at home.",,

We combine the concept of sociotechnical reconfiguration, taken from the South American tradition of “tecnologia social” (social technology), with the three core concepts of Nancy Fraser’s theory of social justice—representation, recognition, and redistribution—to analyze the process by which Black-owned fintechs develop their particular solutions for combating racial bias.

However, efforts to build and scale up HII are fraught with challenges, as exemplified by the well-known case of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Particularly, HII scaling initiatives give rise to tensions, such as across geographical boundaries of EHRs, which are often not effectively addressed in practice. At the same time, there have been calls for research on scaling IS through a practice perspective, which adds to the existing categorical analysis of scale. Thus motivated, we aim to conceptualize the scaling of HII, focusing on the tensions between scales, the practices to accomplish scaling, and their consequences for scaling outcomes. To do so, we undertake a case study of recent NHS efforts to integrate EHRs in England, where we analyze these scalar concepts and their inter-relationships. Through our study, we further develop the notion that scaling not only involves increasing the scale of IS, but entails constructing and reconstructing scales. We also offer theoretical contributions by conceptualizing the range of scalar tensions and practices, their interplay, and influences on HII scaling outcomes. Tensions that we identify as associated with different scale boundaries (organizational, spatial, and technological), extend those recognized in prior research. Furthermore, we uncover scalar practices of joining and differentiating, adding to the governance and architectural approaches for HII scaling examined in past work. Through deepening the understanding of HII scaling, we generate insights for practitioners by highlighting scalar tensions and practices that could address the tensions under different conditions. Overall, we draw attention to scaling phenomena as being integral to the development of HII and introduce a new vocabulary for thinking about HII scaling.",,

We examine this issue by conceptualizing the emergence of IT implementation consequences as a multi-phased process with analytically disaggregated phases. Using an assemblage lens, our theorizing draws on data from a multisite case study of Body-Worn Camera technology implementation in three municipal police organizations in the U.S. We identify three emergence phases—individuation, composition, and actualization—and develop a process model theorizing a path from material and expressive components to IT implementation consequences through cascading properties and capacities. Our model shows that the emergence of IT implementation consequences is non-linear, and involves feedback loops across multiple phases. In some instances, IT implementation consequences may emerge via negative feedback loops involving tweaks and course correction before converging into recognizable new practices. In other instances, they may fail or delay converging into recognizable practices. We also show how combining existing components and assemblages results in nesting assemblages at successively larger scales. This helps us to relativize the micro-macro relationship and explain both top-down and bottom-up emergence of IT implementation consequences.",,

Utilizing an inductive, embedded case study approach, we analyze the interplay between top-down control exerted by platform owners and the bottom-up self-organization of complementors in two enterprise software platform ecosystems. Our findings identify three distinct interaction modes—mandated, supported, and autonomous self-organization—each presenting hierarchical trade-offs between platform owner control and complementor autonomy. Our findings extend the prevalent owner-centric theory of platform governance by highlighting the significant impact of bottom-up self-organization on the governance and evolution of DPEs. We propose an integrated theory that accommodates these new dynamics, suggesting soft power as an effective governance mechanism. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities in governing DPEs and offers practical insights for managing top-down control and bottom-up self-organization in the evolving landscape of enterprise software DPEs.",,

Through this discourse, interested actors advance diverse frames, appealing to consumers with disparate preferences but raising concerns for the coherence of that discourse. We unpack this diversity-coherence paradox by recasting coherence as the relatedness of innovation frames and spotlighting the role of discursive fields that circumscribe meaning. Our empirical context is the first six years of blockchain discourse across seven discursive fields. Our research offers three insights in furtherance of an ecological perspective on innovation discourse. First, framing diversity emanates from discursive fields rather than from actors. Second, fields play differentiated roles in the framing process. Enactment fields comprised of actors with direct experience with the technology limit diversity. They do so by erecting walls that circumscribe discourse through imprinting on their original frame and retracting from or abandoning frames learned from other fields. In contrast, mediated fields, in which actors lack direct experience with the technology, enhance diversity. They do so by imitating or learning from other fields and foreshadowing or anticipating the frames used by other fields, thereby building bridges. Third, rather than opposing each other, diversity and coherence coevolve as the diversity induced by mediated fields increases framing redundancies, synthesizing frames into a coherent community understanding of the innovation. Our research signals to the actors who serve as innovation ambassadors and gatekeepers that diverse views of an innovation are not only inevitable, given the many discourse fields in which those views are formulated, but can also be coherent and desirable.",,

At the same time, proponents of public health have recently called for timely, granular, and actionable data to address a range of public health issues, stressing the need for social listening platforms that can identify and compile this valuable data. Yet previous attempts at social listening in healthcare have yielded mixed results, largely because they have failed to incorporate sufficient context to understand the communications they seek to analyze. Guided by activity theory to design HealthSense, we propose a platform for efficiently sensing and gathering data across the web for real-time analysis to support public health outcomes. HealthSense couples theory-guided content analysis and graph propagation with graph neural networks (GNNs) to assess the relevance and credibility of information, as well as intelligently navigate the complex online channel landscape, leading to significant improvements over existing social listening tools. We demonstrate the value of our artifact in gathering information to support two exemplar public health tasks: (1) performing postmarket drug surveillance for adverse reactions and (2) addressing the opioid crisis by monitoring for potent synthetic opioids released into communities. Our results across data, user, and event experiments show that effective design artifacts can enable better outcomes across both automated and human decision-making contexts, making social listening for public health possible, practical, and valuable. Through our design process, we extend activity theory to address the complexities of modern online communication platforms, where information resides not only in the collection of individual communication activities but also in the complex network of interactions among them.",,

Knowledge about their drivers, and specifically the role of information in stimulating such behaviors, is limited. To address this gap, this paper turns to foraging and risk-sensitivity theories. These theories suggest that animals engage in more dangerous behaviors when their perceived need for calories is high. Similarly, humans increase their financial risk-taking when sensing dissatisfaction with what they have. Importantly, inequality information can increase such perceptions and change people’s risk-taking propensity. Adapting these ideas, the paper postulates that TMDBs resemble food-seeking in animals in that they (1) are goal-oriented, (2) can be dangerous, and (3) yield unknown (probabilistic) rewards. Therefore, TMDBs are explained from foraging and risk-sensitivity theory angles. Focusing on social media users (Studies 1–4; four experiments; total n = 2,504), we argue that (1) it is reasonable to view users as foraging the “fields of social media” for social–hedonic rewards, (2) it is possible to alter their risk appetite and TMDBs through inequality information and upward comparison mechanisms, (3) this process can be mediated not only through cognitions, but also emotions, and (4) perceived scarcity of rewards and social comparison orientation affect this process. Next, the paper extends the core aspects of this theory to the state-level in Study 5 and argues that objective financial inequality can explain differences between U.S. states in TMDBs such as texting while driving and relative interest in TMDBs, such as pranks. The findings largely support these assertions. They illuminate the role of information, notably inequality, in driving TMDBs, extend prior research that has focused on basic needs (e.g., physiological needs in the case of food intake decisions) to the case of higher-order human needs (e.g., needs for belonging, esteem, and self-actualization) as catered to by nonphysiological, social–hedonic rewards, and point to important mechanisms that translate inequality into TMDBs.",,

In the first study, we compare scripts generated using two process modeling grammars and demonstrate how attention paid to specific parts of scripts generated using grammar variations, and differences in visual association between parts of a diagram, account for task performance. In the second study, we use a combination of eye tracking and verbal protocol analysis to examine how visual association between parts of conceptual modeling scripts can indicate cognitive integration while performing problem solving tasks. The studies show that task performance can be explained with different mental processes, reflected in specific eye tracking behavior, where scripts developed following different rules invoke different cognitive processes. We show that attention can be measured by eye tracking and can explain task performance. In addition, we show that visual association (which is observable) between parts of a modeling script involves cognitive integration (which is not observable). This finding can be used to improve conceptual modeling grammars in several ways, including understanding the effects of alternative visual arrangements of models on how effectively they communicate domain knowledge for particular tasks, and guiding the design of visual modeling notations.",,

Grounded in the “agentic” systems delegation framework and instance-based learning theory, we employ a hidden Markov model to a longitudinal study of the dynamic delegation decision-making process involving 875 store managers. We find there is a potential polarization in managers’ delegation willingness, with managers who recognize the capability of AI exhibiting high delegation willingness and fostering increased collaboration with AI over time, in contrast to their counterparts who are inclined to reduce AI’s involvement. During human-AI interactions, managers’ continuous performance appraisal of AI shapes their dynamic delegation willingness, which in turn affects their assessment of AI capability. This process forms a delegation feedback loop that drives the dynamics of delegation behaviors. Our study indicates that managers with a high willingness to delegate tend to outperform their counterparts and offers valuable insights for human-AI collaborative intelligence in organizational settings.",,

Such ambitions, if successfully advanced, may even elevate the complementor’s position in the platform ecosystem to that of a focal actor. However, transitioning from non-focal actor to focal actor is challenging. Along the way, the non-focal actor may need to choose between the seemingly unfavorable alternatives of acting on its growth ambitions—risking losing the focal actors’ support needed for that growth—or relinquishing its ambitions to ensure the support of the focal actors continues. We refer to this phenomenon as the complementor’s dilemma, and we unpack the process whereby a non-focal actor can pursue growth ambitions while successfully managing relationships with the focal platforms in the ecosystem. To address this research problem, we conducted an in-depth, embedded case study of a Chinese short-form video platform, Douyin (known as TikTok outside of China), from its inception as a complement in 2016 to its establishment as a focal actor in 2018. During this two-year period, Douyin grew spectacularly from 0.75 million to 208.28 million users. We examine the process through which Douyin navigated the complementor’s dilemma multiple times within the confines of its dependency on Weibo and WeChat, the focal actors in China’s social network platform ecosystem. We contribute to the platform ecosystem literature by offering a process perspective that conceptualizes the complementor’s dilemma and theorizes how to navigate the dilemma when transitioning from a non-focal actor to a focal actor in a platform ecosystem.",,

This paper bridges this gap by addressing two questions: (1) do women and men have similar opportunities to acquire skills related to new IT innovations, and (2) how do these differences affect the gender pay gap? We argue that women are underrepresented in roles that use emerging technologies due to two interrelated processes: demand-side labor market conditions and supply-side job sorting. By analyzing two independent datasets that provide insights into wages, career trajectories, and skill prerequisites for IT roles, we find that women are less likely to apply for jobs requiring expertise with emerging technologies. Such positions often require extended work hours, frequent job mobility, and geographic relocation—which can conflict with the family responsibilities typically assumed by women. Yet, because these positions tend to offer higher wages, women’s underrepresentation in these roles exacerbates the gender pay gap in the IT sector. Our findings stress the importance of creating more flexible job structures and enhancing women’s access to emerging technology roles as critical for achieving gender equity in the IT industry.",,

In investigating this issue, this paper makes a case for complementing current category-based approaches to social justice, prevalent in literature and policy on OLPs, with a flow-oriented approach that recognizes the diversity of gig work trajectories when it comes to the situated enactment of social (in)justice. Inspired by the recent work of Tim Ingold and building upon seminal work on social justice by Rawls and Sen, we develop a synthetic framework for revealing the social justice implications of OLPs, in terms of the enactment of opportunities and/or barriers, from three perspectives: access to resources, capabilities to function, and correspondences with flows. The latter perspective temporally reinterprets the former two and offers a processual flow-oriented approach to social justice. We further substantiate and showcase the added value of our approach through an empirical investigation of different gig work stories on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform and discuss how our flow-oriented approach leads to revealing social justice implications not foregrounded through other approaches. Specifically, we develop three flow-oriented social justice tests that can be applied in various OLP contexts to assess their social justice implications. Finally, we derive remedial design and policy principles that can serve to reshape dialogue about social justice on OLPs, both theoretically and practically, in a manner that is more relevant and responsive to the fluid and evolving realities faced by gig workers.",,

Drawing on a case study of the use of an ADM system in public school administration, we explore the practices through which public institutions avoided engagement with the detrimental consequences of ADM, leading to injustice. We provide a conceptual model outlining how organizational ignoring practices can lead to social and institutional blackboxing of an ADM system, engendering both social and legal injustice. Our work paves the way for interdisciplinary research on the multilayered blackboxing of ADM. We also extend algorithmic injustice research to include a legal dimension and provide practical implications in the form of a legal framework for ADM in the public sector.",,

We borrow the concept of modulation from audio synthesis to explain how a preexisting signal—in our case, the ongoing community discourse—is modulated to produce varying sounds—in our case, the novelty and complexity of the software. The concept of modulation offers a lens to understand how emergent, community-wide development activities are influenced by filtering discursive positions and mixing those positions, thereby shaping the artifact’s novelty and complexity. Our research shows that the modulation of novelty exhibits a range from “proximal” to “distal” searches for new features, while the modulation of complexity varies between “integration” and “deprecation.” By drawing on these concepts, we formulate a theory that explains how modulation results in alternative OSS community approaches to shaping software novelty and complexity and how this process reflects and is reflected in the resulting software artifact.",,

To shed light on this issue, we leveraged institutional theory and examined how U.S. state data breach notification laws (DBNLs), under which firms must notify customers of personal information breaches, influenced firm-level incidence of security breaches and how such influence manifested heterogeneously across firms. Exploiting the staggered enactments of DBNLs in a difference-in-differences analysis, we found that firms experienced a significant reduction in data breach incidents after the implementation of DBNLs. This effect was more pronounced among firms that were more reliant on sensitive customer data, operated in stricter privacy protection environments, or held more intangible and digital assets. We document evidence that compared to firms not subject to DBNLs, firms subject to these laws are more likely to appoint IT-specialized executives and remediate IT-related internal control weaknesses, which suggests potential channels that may facilitate DBNLs’ curbing of data breaches. We also found that the reduction in breach incidences following DBNL-mandated disclosure policies relates to both endogenous breaches and exogenous cyberattacks.",,

This scalable evaluation mechanism offers a collective benefit. However, contestants may also leverage it to achieve personal, competitive benefits. Our study examines this tension from a status-theoretic perspective, suggesting that the conflict between competitive and collective benefits, and the net implication for evaluation efficacy, is influenced by contestants’ status. On the one hand, contestants of lower status may be viewed as less skilled and hence more likely to make mistakes. Therefore, low-status contestants may attract more evaluations if said evaluations are driven predominantly by an interest in collective benefits. On the other hand, if evaluations are driven largely by an interest in personal, competitive benefits, a low-status contestant makes for a less attractive target and hence may attract fewer evaluations. We empirically test these competing possibilities using a dataset of coding contests from Codeforces. The platform allows contestants to assess others’ submissions and improve evaluations (a collective benefit) by devising test cases (hacks) in addition to those defined by the contest organizer. If a submission is successfully hacked, the hacker earns additional points, and the target submission is eliminated from the contest (a competitive benefit). We begin by providing qualitative evidence based on semi-structured interviews conducted with contestants spanning the status spectrum at Codeforces. Next, we present quantitative evidence exploiting a structural change at Codeforces wherein many contestants experienced an arbitrary status reduction unrelated to their performance because of sudden changes to the platform’s color-coding system around contestant ratings. We show that status-loser contestants received systematically more evaluations from other contestants, absent changes in their short-run submission quality. Finally, we show that the excess evaluations allocated toward affected contestants were less effective, indicating status-driven evaluations as potentially less efficacious. We discuss the implications of our findings for managing evaluation processes in online contests.",,

However, in allowing practically anyone to enter, such platforms enable opportunistic suppliers to flood the market with offerings, many of which are of low quality. This situation creates choice overload for potential backers and may thus influence their investment decisions. To empirically study the implications of this phenomenon for crowdfunding performance, we use a quasi-natural experiment in the form of an exogenous media shock that occurred on Kickstarter.com. The shock was followed by a sharp increase in the number of campaigns, particularly low-quality ones, offered on the supply side of the market; no such increase was observed on the demand side of the market. These unique conditions enable us to estimate how crowdfunding platforms are affected by the presence of an atypically large number of low-quality campaigns, while controlling for fluctuations in demand. We use two identification strategies, which enable us to control for changes in quality, to show that an increase in low-quality supply significantly decreases the performance of the average crowdfunding campaign, manifested in a lower likelihood of success (reaching funding goals) and less money raised per campaign. We also offer a new measure to estimate campaign quality and study the moderating role of campaign quality in the observed effects. We find that high-quality campaigns are less affected than low-quality campaigns by the influx of low-quality offerings.

We analyzed a natural experiment that decreased the tax rate, and hence also the net prices of e-books, by 14% in Ireland while several other European countries were not affected. Using country-specific data on piracy visits, we found that this price decrease caused only a small and statistically insignificant decrease in total e-book piracy visits. However, we further decomposed piracy visits into those of direct pirates, who navigated directly to piracy sites, and indirect pirates, who searched to find piracy sites. The 14% price decrease caused no change in direct piracy visits but caused a statistically significant 27% decrease in indirect piracy visits. These findings align with prior research suggesting that search can play an important role in piracy, but only for some pirates. Our results demonstrate the potential of using price to mitigate piracy, but they also highlight the challenges firms face in competing with piracy for experienced pirates.

The bank serves over 50 million customers and previously used a traditional rule-based model to evaluate the default risk of each loan application. It recently developed an AI model with a higher prediction accuracy of default risk and used the AI model and the traditional model together to assess loan applications for one of its personal loan products. Although the AI model may be more accurate in estimating default risk, little is known about its impact on financial inclusion. We investigated this question using a difference-in-differences approach by comparing changes in financial inclusion of the personal loan product that adopted the AI model to that of a similar personal loan product that did not adopt the AI model. We found that the AI model enhanced financial inclusion for the underserved population by simultaneously increasing the approval rate and reducing the default rate. Further analysis attributed the enhancement in financial inclusion to the use of weak signals (i.e., data not conventionally used to evaluate creditworthiness) by the AI model and its sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Our findings are consistent with statistical discrimination theory, as the use of weak signals and sophisticated machine learning algorithms improves prediction accuracy at the individual level, thus reducing the reliance on group characteristics that often lead to financial exclusion. We elaborated on the development process of the AI model to illustrate how and why the AI model can better evaluate members of underserved populations. We also found the impacts of the AI model to be heterogeneous across subgroups, and those with missing weak signals saw smaller improvements in the approval rate. A simulation-based analysis showed that simplified AI models were also able to increase the approval rate and reduce the default rate for this population. Our findings provide rich theoretical and practical implications for social justice by documenting how an AI model designed for improving prediction accuracy can enhance financial inclusion.",,

As part of the growing “secondary market” landscape, these online B2B auctions are significantly affected by adverse selection since uncertainty about product quality from their first life remains in place. We study how these adverse selection costs may be identified and reduced in online B2B auctions for mobile phones using a proprietary data set for pallets of iPhone devices. We focus on the differences between carrier-locked and unlocked iPhones, and the degree to which the jailbreaking of devices may lead to adverse selection costs. We first show that uncertainty with respect to the possibility of jailbreaking-to-unlock induces significant adverse selection costs in this market. We identify a clear method that these adverse selection costs may be reduced through policies implemented in the primary market. We find that adverse selection costs exist with respect to jailbreaking-to-unlock, by comparing prices obtained for locked and unlocked devices, as well as pallets where this information is not disclosed. However, when some of the uncertainty surrounding jailbreaking-to-unlock is removed by virtue of an exogenous policy change implemented by Verizon in the primary market, i.e., to sell all iPhones as factory unlocked, adverse selection costs are significantly reduced. Our work has significant implications for enhancing the efficiency of secondary markets for IT products, by virtue of highlighting the connections between primary and secondary markets.

Consonantly, extant conceptual schemas can encode the semantics of a domain intensionally (e.g., ER diagram, UML class diagram) or extensionally (e.g., set diagram, UML object diagram). However, prior IS research has exclusively focused on intensional representations and the role they play in aiding domain understanding. In this research, we compare the interpretational fidelity of two types of representational encoding of cardinality constraints, an intensional schema using an ER diagram and its extensional analog using a set diagram. We employ cognitive science research to conceptualize that extensional representations will enable enhanced understanding as compared with intensional representations. Further, given that prior research suggests that the semantics of cardinality constraints remain challenging to understand, we focus on mandatory and optional cardinality constraints associated with relationships in these representations. Based on our laboratory experiments, we find that understanding with an extensional representation was (1) at least as good as that with an intensional representation for mandatory cardinality constraints and (2) significantly better for optional cardinality constraints. We also conducted an applicability check of our results via focus groups and found support for the perceived significance of extensional representations in practice. Overall, this research suggests that the tradition in IS research of exclusively focusing on intensional encoding of domain semantics should be reexamined.",,

We argue that, in order to garner potential benefits of the local information and knowledge resources embedded in citizens’ advice networks, hybrid governance that combines leadership by the local government and the technology sponsor is required. We further theorize that leadership by the local government or the technology sponsor for different stages of the ICT4D initiative affects the salience of the pathways through which benefits of citizens’ advice networks accrue. We found support, in a longitudinal field study in 10 villages in India (2,980 heads of households), for our theory that hybrid governance modes outperform those that are homogeneous. Leadership by the local government for the pre-launch stage and by the technology sponsor for the post-launch stage was the most effective in promoting the behavioral pathway for economic benefits—that is, leveraging advice networks for ICT use and consequently realizing gains in income. In contrast, leadership by the technology sponsor for the pre-launch stage and by the local government for the post-launch stage was the most effective in promoting the informational pathway—that is, leveraging information and knowledge from advice networks to directly generate gains in income.

To achieve this, retailers occasionally alter their shipping policies. While information systems research has extensively examined e-commerce channel strategies and their interplay with offline channels, it has yet to explore the online and offline implications of changes in e-commerce shipping policy. Against this backdrop, we study a shipping policy change designed to incentivize higher-dollar orders, specifically, a large multichannel retailer’s shift from a tiered online shipping policy to a flat-rate policy. Using rich customer-level panel data and a regression discontinuity in time approach, we demonstrate that a flat-fee online shipping policy, counterintuitively, shifts sales away from the online channel and toward the offline channel—generating 23% more offline sales across 21,028 customers in five states. Evidence from additional analyses corroborates an account based on two mechanisms: an online order aggregation effect, wherein flat-fee shipping encourages shipping fee-sensitive shoppers to aggregate purchases into larger orders, and an offline store interpurchase effect, wherein order aggregation generates longer interpurchase periods, during which customers meet their needs for smaller purchases by visiting the offline store. Thus, a flat-rate shipping policy can serve as an unexpected lever for driving multichannel behavior. These findings contribute to the e-commerce channel interplay literature within information systems research and have important implications for legacy retailers seeking to leverage their brick-and-mortar investments to fend off the likes of Amazon.com.",,

Often this takes the form of company employees devoting their time to contribute code to the efforts of projects in these communities. Ideology has traditionally served to motivate, coordinate, and guide volunteer contributions to OSS communities. As employees represent an increasing proportion of the participants in OSS communities, the role of OSS ideology in guiding their commitment and code contributions is unknown. In this research, we argue that OSS ideology misfit has important implications for companies and the OSS communities to which their employees contribute, since their engagement in such communities is not necessarily voluntary. We conceptualize two different types of misfit: OSS ideology under-fit, whereby an employee embraces an OSS ideology more than their coworkers or OSS community do, and OSS ideology over-fit, whereby an employee perceives that their coworkers or OSS community embrace the OSS ideology more strongly than the employee does. To develop a set of hypotheses about the implications of these two types of misfit for employee commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community, we draw on self-determination theory. We test the hypotheses in a field study of 186 employees who participate in an OSS community. We find that OSS ideology under-fit impacts the company and the community in the same way: it decreases employee commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community. In contrast, we find that OSS ideology over-fit increases commitment to the company but decreases commitment to the OSS community. Finally, we find that employees’ commitment to their company reinforces the impact of their commitment to the OSS community in driving ongoing code contributions. This provides a holistic view of OSS ideology and its impacts among an increasingly pervasive yet understudied type of participant in OSS research. It provides insights for companies that are considering assigning their employees to work in OSS communities as well as for OSS communities that are partnering with these companies.",,

To explore this research problem, we utilize the punctuated equilibrium theory and a case study of IT consumerization and the transformation of IT governance in a large global bank. Our findings suggest that the widespread adoption of digital technology in everyday life leads to “everyone’s IT,” which is a new set of shared beliefs among consumers that highlights democratized access and individualized use of IT. As everyone’s IT beliefs begin to alter the IT-related activities of workers, the result is IT governance misalignments that ultimately lead to a punctuated transformation of IT governance that dismantles functional IT governance.

Anchoring on both social transformation theory and affordance actualization theory, we conducted an in-depth qualitative study with two rounds of data collection in China. In addition to investigating how the societal challenge has triggered transformative HIT interventions, our analysis contributes to a theory on an HIT solution for the rural-urban healthcare access inequality challenge by establishing a link between HIT affordances and HIT interventions. This is done by examining how microlevel HIT effects escalate to macrolevel HIT effects through societal-level affordance actualization, which can affect this healthcare access inequality challenge.

This regulatory construction was enabled by collective prospective sensemaking relying on the interrelated processes of abstraction and elaboration, through which actors collectively reconceptualized the regulatory target in terms of the technology (from blockchain to trustworthy technology), its uses (from cryptocurrency to token economy), and required roles (from financial service provider roles to trustworthy technology systems roles). Abstraction allowed the group of actors to extract and generalize essential properties to support the regulatory goals of technology neutrality and innovation-friendliness. Elaboration allowed the group to identify and specify details and requirements to support the regulatory goals of creating legal certainty and protecting users.

To do so, we first describe the basic tenets of SD and discuss the status quo of existing SD applications in the field. Then, we demonstrate how to model SD’s unique theoretical logic of reciprocal and temporal causal structure to extend existing variance theory. To demonstrate the use of SD in theory development, we develop and validate an SD model of the e-commerce resource endowment of a click-and-mortar firm and simulate dynamic causal relationships between the e-commerce resource endowment and firm performance over time, under various scenarios. This case demonstrates how we can extend an existing variance theory by reconciling the inconsistent findings of prior research from a system perspective using the SD approach.

Among these challenges, recent scholarly calls have pushed for more research on the infusion of emerging technologies into the service-profit chain (SPC) framework, advocating for the importance of extended knowledge to develop a techno-infused version of the SPC. Thus, from an interdisciplinary perspective, we draw upon role theory and propose a technoservice-profit chain (TSPC). Specifically, we contextualize the SPC in the technoservice context with different approaches, including decomposing context-specific constructs and theorizing IACS implementation as a contextual factor that moderates TSPC relationships. Using a sequential mixed methods design combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, we tested our research model by conducting multiwave surveys and follow-up interviews in a large business-to-business service firm with data from employees, supervisors, and customers before and after IACS implementation. This interdisciplinary study contributes to the information systems, service marketing, and management literatures by enriching the compositions of core SPC constructs, theorizing interactions between human agents and technology agents, and scrutinizing the impacts of technology agents on the linkages between internal employee management and external customer service.

To mitigate this concern, some platforms, such as Airbnb, have adopted the bilateral review system (BRS), allowing buyers and sellers to rate each other. This differs from the traditional unilateral review system (URS), which allows only buyers to rate sellers. In this study, we examine how these two review systems impact the operation of a peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing platform, where sellers with different qualities are matched with buyers with different serving costs. Our analysis reveals that under URS, even with perfect seller information, high-quality sellers can still be driven out of the market due to unknown information about the buyer and the “coproduction” nature of the serving cost. This differs from the adverse selection problem often observed in the used car market, for example, where sellers of high-quality products withdraw due to generally unknown product quality. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of the expected buyer cost: When this cost is high, BRS can benefit the platform by alleviating the adverse selection problem; however, when this cost is low, BRS becomes detrimental to the platform. Our analysis also shows that BRS helps buyers but can hurt sellers. However, BRS has the potential to generate a favorable outcome for all parties involved, resulting in a win-win-win situation benefiting the platform, buyers, and sellers. Our results not only shed light on review system design but also provide a plausible explanation for the widespread use of BRS by sharing platforms such as Airbnb, Fiverr, and Turo.",,

A potential strategy for a platform with market disadvantage is to make itself compatible with competitors to attract multihoming of developers. However, many questions remain unresolved regarding how a platform’s compatibility strategy impacts developers’ multihoming decisions and subsequent app performance. In this study, we use the context of web browser platforms (i.e., Firefox and Chrome) to investigate how the increase in the technological compatibility of a secondary platform (Firefox) influences developer multihoming from a primary dominant platform (Chrome). We theoretically consider how increased platform compatibility influences the trade-offs in developers’ multihoming decisions and their subsequent app development choices. Based on this trade-off perspective, we posit and empirically investigate the effects of increased platform compatibility on developer multihoming, and the subsequent development choices and app performance resulting from multihoming. Our findings illustrate that developers with larger user bases on the primary platform are more willing to multihome than those with smaller bases, but increased platform compatibility reduces this gap and enables developers with smaller user bases to better embrace multihoming. Increased platform compatibility also encourages multihoming developers to develop exclusive apps for the secondary platform. Moreover, increased platform compatibility facilitates multihoming developers to leverage their primary-platform user bases to enhance their secondary-platform app performance, and this effect is influenced by the development type (porting or exclusive development). Our study generates unique insights that add to the theoretical understanding of platform compatibility, multihoming, and platform competition.",,

Consequently, review hosting platforms have adjusted their designs to feature a signal “distilled” from a selective set of “top reviews” and their valences. The expected ease with which customers process this signal is intended to increase their satisfaction, thus reducing dispersion in their subsequent review ratings. In this study, we analyze the influential role that top reviews and their valence play under various scenarios: when customers are overloaded by a large number of reviews, when top reviews themselves are not parsimonious in number, and when the signals from top reviews are not in concordance with that from all the other reviews. We find that the valence of top reviews plays a central role in mitigating information overload. However, the influence of those top reviews diminishes when they too pose an overload risk but is strengthened when their signal is reaffirmed by signals from all other reviews.
