G.",2004,"AIR VERSUS OXYGEN FOR RESUSCITATION OF INFANTS AT BIRTH","Cochrane Database Syst Rev",,3,"Cd002273","BACKGROUND: 100% oxygen is the commonly recommended gas for the resuscitation of infants at birth. There is growing evidence from both animal and human studies that room air is as effective as 100% oxygen and that 100% oxygen may have adverse effects on breathing physiology and cerebral circulation. There is also the theoretical risk of tissue damage due to free oxygen radicals when 100% oxygen is given. The use of room air has therefore been suggested as a safer and possibly more effective alternative. OBJECTIVES: In newborn infants requiring resuscitation does the use of room air reduce the incidence of death neurological disability and short term morbidity when compared with the use of 100% oxygen? SEARCH STRATEGY: This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL The Cochrane Library Issue 1 2004) and MEDLINE PubMed 1966 to December 2003 and handsearches of reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing the use of room air or any other concentration of oxygen versus 100% oxygen in the resuscitation of infants at birth. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and extracted data independently. When appropriate meta-analysis was conducted to provide a pooled estimate of effect. For categorical data the relative risk (RR) risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean difference (WMD). MAIN RESULTS: Five studies were identified which enrolled a total of 1302 infants. In two studies allocation was randomised and the caregivers were blinded to intervention group. In the other three studies allocation was quasi-randomised and the caregivers were not blinded. Pooled analysis of the four trials reporting effect on death showed a significant reduction in the rate of death in the group resuscitated with room air [typical RR 0.71 (0.54 0.94) typical RD -0.05 (-0.08 -0.01) NNT 20 (12 100)]. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to rates of grade 2 or 3 hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. One of the four trials reported a statistically significant difference in median 5 minute Apgar scores favouring the group allocated to room air. However the absolute difference between the medians was small and there were no significant differences in the median 10 minute Apgar scores in the three trials reporting this outcome. One trial followed up a selected subgroup of survivors to 18-24 months. There were no significant differences in rates of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes including cerebral palsy and failure to achieve various milestones; however the proportion of eligible patients seen was less than 70%. Analyses that were planned for this review but not able to be carried out because of lack of published data included a sub-analysis stratified by gestational age and assessments of the effect on bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence at present on which to recommend a policy of using room air over 100% oxygen or vice versa for newborn resuscitation. A reduction in mortality has been seen in infants resuscitated with room air and no evidence of harm has been demonstrated. However the small number of identified studies and their methodologic limitations dictate caution in interpreting and applying these results. We note the use of back-up 100% oxygen in more than a quarter of infants randomised to room air. Therefore on the basis of currently available evidence if one chooses room air as the initial gas for resuscitation supplementary oxygen should continue to be made available.","10.1002/14651858.CD002273.pub2","1361-6137",

Synergy between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and alcohol in promoting liver cell damage and disease progression has been reported. However the interaction of HBV and ethanol in hepatic steatosis development has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were treated with or without HBV ethanol or the combination of HBV and ethanol (HBV+EtOH) followed by a three-week high-fat diet (HFD) regimen. Liver histology serum biomarkers and liver triglyceride levels were analysed. Furthermore a meta-analysis of the effects of alcohol and HBV on hepatic steatosis in populations was performed. RESULTS: Hepatic steatosis was significantly more severe in the HBV+EtOH group than in the other groups. The serum alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase and liver triglyceride levels in the HBV+EtOH group were also significantly higher than those in the other groups. The HBeAg and HBsAg levels in the HBV+EtOH group were significantly higher than those in the pair-fed HBV-infected mice. In addition the meta-analysis showed that alcohol consumption increased the risk of hepatic steatosis by 43% in HBV-infected patients (pooled risk ratio (RR)=1.43 P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and HBV synergistically promote high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice. In addition alcohol consumption increases the risk of hepatic steatosis in HBV-infected patients.","10.1016/j.aohep.2019.04.013","1665-2681 (Print)

"id_0029057","article","Kunkel D.Kaizar E. E.",2017,"A COMPARISON OF EXISTING METHODS FOR MULTIPLE IMPUTATION IN INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT DATA META-ANALYSIS","Stat Med",36,22,"3507-3532","Multiple imputation is a popular method for addressing missing data but its implementation is difficult when data have a multilevel structure and one or more variables are systematically missing. This systematic missing data pattern may commonly occur in meta-analysis of individual participant data where some variables are never observed in some studies but are present in other hierarchical data settings. In these cases valid imputation must account for both relationships between variables and correlation within studies. Proposed methods for multilevel imputation include specifying a full joint model and multiple imputation with chained equations (MICE). While MICE is attractive for its ease of implementation there is little existing work describing conditions under which this is a valid alternative to specifying the full joint model. We present results showing that for multilevel normal models MICE is rarely exactly equivalent to joint model imputation. Through a simulation study and an example using data from a traumatic brain injury study we found that in spite of theoretical differences MICE imputations often produce results similar to those obtained using the joint model. We also assess the influence of prior distributions in MICE imputation methods and find that when missingness is high prior choices in MICE models tend to affect estimation of across-study variability more than compatibility of conditional likelihoods.

FRESHLY CULTURED MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL POTENCY AND/OR SURROGATE MEASURES OF EFFICACY IN PRECLINICAL STUDIES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","Cytotherapy","20 (5 Supplement 1)",,"S78","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that demonstrate therapeutic potential for treatment of immune-mediated diseases such as septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recent preclinical studies suggest that freshly thawed previously frozen MSCs may have reduced immunomodulatory activity immediately post-thaw thus may not be as effective or potent as freshly cultured MSCs. From a cell manufacturing and clinical perspective freshly cultured MSCs present logistical and financial challenges especially for treatment of acute conditions such as stroke and septic shock that require intervention within hours of diagnosis. A systematic search was performed to examine potency and/or surrogate measures of efficacy in in vitro and in vivo studies comparing freshly thawed versus freshly cultured MSCs. A pre-defined search strategy of MEDLINE and EMBASE (to October 2016) identified prospective in vivo and in vitro studies that compared freshly thawed to freshly cultured MSCs. Studies administering MSCs with other experimental therapies or cell types and those that did not report on potency or surrogate measures of efficacy were excluded. Two independent reviewers appraised 1058 citations and 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data was abstracted by a single reviewer on the general characteristics of the study (e.g. study design comparative groups sample size) animal model MSC (e.g. source cryopreservation solution and protocol route of administration and cell dose). Data was also collected for the overall potency and measure of efficacy. A total of 185 animals (n = 145 mouse; n = 40 rat) from 4 in vivo studies with clinical conditions of retinal ischemia allergic airway inflammation healthy lung and acute lung injury; as well as 5 in vitro studies were included. Preliminary findings suggest that freshly thawed previously frozen MSCs have comparable potency and/or surrogate measures of efficacy to freshly cultured MSCs.",,"1477-2566",

This article will review our current understanding of the link between insulin resistance and intestinal lipoprotein overproduction and highlight some of the key recent findings in the field. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging evidence from several animal models of insulin resistance as well as insulin-resistant humans clearly supports the link between insulin resistance and aberrant intestinal lipoprotein metabolism. In insulin-resistant states elevated free fatty acid flux into the intestine downregulation of intestinal insulin signaling and upregulation of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein all appear to stimulate intestinal lipoprotein production. Gut peptides GLP-1 and GLP-2 may be important regulators of intestinal lipid absorption and lipoprotein production. SUMMARY: Available evidence in humans and animal models strongly favors the concept that the small intestine is not merely an absorptive organ but rather plays an active role in regulating the rate of production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Metabolic signals in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and in some cases an aberrant intestinal response to these factors all contribute to the enhanced formation and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.","10.1097/MOL.0b013e3282ffaf82","0957-9672 (Print)
