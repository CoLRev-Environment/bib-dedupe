OBX in male Wistar rats produced an increase in lipid peroxidation products and a decline in reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity together with an increase in caspase-3 activity. Additionally OBX triggered changes of behavior such as an enhancement of immobility time in the forced swim test and hyperactivity in the open field test. These changes were reversed by treatment with 17betaE<inf>2</inf> (14 days). Our results reveled that 17betaE<inf>2</inf> has a protective effect against oxidative stress cell damage and behavioral changes induced by OBX and present antidepressant and antianxiety properties.

            "Many Veterans exposed to physical and psychological trauma experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As the etiology of PTSD symptoms is complex a better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms may improve preventative care and treatment for PTSD. Recent findings from the fields of neuroimaging and epigenetics offer important insights into the potential brain structures and biochemical pathways of modified gene expression associated with PTSD. We combined neuroimaging and epigenetic measures to assess current PTSD symptoms by measuring overall hippocampal volume and methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene (promoter region). Multiple regression analyses indicated that the hippocampal volume/GR methylation interaction was a predictor of PTSD symptoms. Our findings suggest that neuroimaging and epigenetic measures contribute interactively to PTSD symptoms. Incorporation of these metrics may aid in the identification and treatment of PTSD patients.

            "Recent evidence has suggested that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) induced by shortterm caloric restriction (CR) protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Because AMPK plays a central role in regulating energy metabolism we investigated whether alterations in cardiac energy metabolism contribute to the cardioprotective effects induced by CR. Hearts from control or short-term CR mice were subjected to ex vivo I/R and metabolism as well as post-ischemic functional recovery was measured. Even in the presence of elevated levels of fatty acids CR significantly improved recovery of cardiac function following ischemia. While rates of fatty acid oxidation or glycolysis from exogenous glucose were similar between groups improved functional recovery post-ischemia in CR hearts was associated with high rates of glucose oxidation during reperfusion compared to controls. Consistent with CR improving energy supply hearts from CR mice had increased ATP levels as well as lower AMPK activity at the end of reperfusion compared to controls. Furthermore in agreement with the emerging concept that CR is a non-conventional form of pre-conditioning we observed a significant increase in phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 at the end of reperfusion. These data also suggest that activation of the reperfusion salvage kinase (RISK) pathway also contributes to the beneficial effects of CR in reducing post-ischemia contractile dysfunction. These findings also suggest that short-term CR improves post-ischemic recovery by promoting glucose oxidation and activating the RISK pathway. As such pre-operative CR may be a clinically relevant strategy for increasing ischemic tolerance of the heart. Springer-Verlag 2010.",

            "Background: Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) causes myocyte injury as a consequence of ischemia and reperfusion. Previous studies have shown that hypoxia or hypoxia-mimetic agents (cobalt chloride CoCl<sub>2</sub> or deferoxamine DFX) limit myocyte necrosis by upregulating the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor. However it remains unknown whether these agents attenuate myocardial apoptosis after DHCA. This study tested the hypotheses (1) that hypoxia DFX or CoCl<sub>2</sub> preconditioning attenuates myocardial apoptosis during DHCA; and (2) that the protective mechanism involves the altered expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins pAkt (antiapoptotic) Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic) and Bax (proapoptotic). Methods: Anesthetized neonatal piglets were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 6 in a group): control (NaCl injection); hypoxia (pO<sub>2</sub> of 30 to 40 mm Hg for 3 hours); DFX injection; or CoCl<sub>2</sub> injection. Twenty-four hours later the animals underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and 110 minutes of DHCA. One week after CPB percentage of apoptotic myocytes (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL assay) and expression of the pAKT Bcl-2 and Bax were assessed by Western blot. Results: Although preconditioning with hypoxia and DFX failed to show a protective benefit CoCl<sub>2</sub> pretreatment significantly attenuated myocardial apoptosis (9.3% +/- 4.1%) versus controls (33.8% +/- 9.7% p = 0.042). That was associated with increased myocardial pAkt expression (0.19 +/- 0.006 in CoCl<sub>2</sub> versus 0.12 +/- 0.008 in control p < 0.001). The expression of Bcl-2 was also significantly higher in the CoCl<sub>2</sub> group (0.15 +/- 0.02) versus control (0.11 +/- 0.01 p = 0.007) whereas Bax expression was lower (0.34 +/- 0.04 versus 0.54 +/- 0.03 for control p < 0.001). Conclusions: Preconditioning with CoCl<sub>2</sub> before prolonged DHCA in neonatal piglets attenuates myocardial apoptosis by mechanisms involving phosphorylation of Akt upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax. 2006 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",

            "Background. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) reduces infarct size in experimental preparations. IPC however is not without detrimental effects We studied amrinone as a possible alternative to IPC. Methods. Isolated perfused rabbit hearts were given a 5-minute infusion of 10 mumol/L amrinone followed by a 5-minute washout (n = 6). The anterior descending artery was then occluded for 1 hour and reperfused for 1 hour. Six hearts underwent IPC with two episodes of 5-minute global ischemia followed by 5-minute reperfusion before LAD occlusion; eight control hearts received no preconditioning. Left ventricular pressure and ischemic zone epicardial monophasic action potentials were continuously monitored. Results. IPC but not amrinone reduced peak pressure before anterior descending artery occlusion. Peak pressure fell significantly during ischemia and reperfusion in all hearts. End diastolic pressure rose significantly during reperfusion in control and IPC hearts but not in amrinone hearts. Action potentials shortened during ischemia in all hearts. They returned to preocclusion values in control hearts but lasted beyond preocclusion values in IPC and amrinone hearts. Both the incidences of ventricular fibrillation and infarct size were significantly reduced in amrinone hearts but not in IPC hearts. Conclusions. Amrinone is not only a useful inotropic agent but is also a superior preconditioning agent when compared to IPC. (C) 2000 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",
