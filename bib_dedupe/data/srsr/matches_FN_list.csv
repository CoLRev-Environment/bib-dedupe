id_0005784;id_0005785,id_0005784,article,swedishcouncilonhealthtechnologyassessment,2007,sbu systematic review summaries,,,,this report presents the scientific evidence for the methods currently used or in the process of being adopted to detect fetal chromosomal and structural abnormalities during early pregnancy. medical social psychological ethical health economic quality assurance and safety aspects of early prenatal diagnosis were analysed. this summary reviews the questions addressed and the most important conclusions reached in each chapter of the report. in the first section sbus main conclusions are presented. conclusions a combined test of ultrasound nuchal translucency measurement and maternal serum biochemistry biochemical screening in early pregnancy 1014 gestational weeks along with maternal age is the clinically evaluated method of assessing the probability of fetal down syndrome that gives the best balance between the percentage of detected cases and falsepositive results strong scientific evidence. maternal serum biochemistry with four markers quadruple test is the clinically evaluated method of assessing the probability of fetal down syndrome that in the second trimester gives the best balance between the percentage of detected cases and falsepositive results strong scientific evidence. all the methods nuchal translucency measurement maternal serum biochemistry in the second trimester and the combined test for assessing the probability of fetal down syndrome examined by this report and evaluated in clinical practice gives a better balance between the percentage of detected cases and falsepositive results than maternal age alone. thus the use of these methods requires fewer amniocenteses and chorionic villus samplings per detected cases of down syndrome than maternal age alone strong scientific evidence. use of the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization fish test or quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction qf pcr is essentially as accurate as full karyotyping for detecting aneuploidies in chromosomes 13 18 21 x and y strong scientific evidence. normal results on the rapid fish test or qfpcr in prenatal diagnosis leave a residual possibility of fetal chromosomal abnormalities. in approximately 0.9 of all amniocenteses and chorionic villus samplings a full karyotype analysis will detect a chromosomal abnormality missed by the rapid fish test or qfpcr. for chromosomal abnormalities of clinical significance the figure is 0.4 strong scientific evidence. fewer congenital abnormalities including heart defects appear to be detected when a routine ultrasound examination is performed at 12 instead of 18 gestational weeks. that is the case even if the 12week examination includes nuchal translucency measurement and if increased nuchal translucency or greater probability of chromosomal abnormalities according to nuchal translucency is an indication for a comprehensive fetal anatomy at 1822 gestational weeks. however the scientific evidence is insufficient to draw a reliable conclusion in this regard. no detrimental impact of ultrasound exposure during the second trimester has been demonstrated on childrens growth vision or hearing or their neurological cognitive or speech development. no correlation has been demonstrated between prenatal ultrasound exposure and childhood malignancies strong scientific evidence. a metaanalysis of randomized trials have not shown any difference with respect to the frequency of nonright handedness left handedness or no clear preference between controls and groups assigned to in utero exposure to ultrasound. analyses of subpopulations and two swedish registry studies have found a correlation between such exposure and nonright handedness in boys. however the scientific evidence is insufficient to draw a reliable conclusion. invasive tests amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling increase the risk of fetal loss. the best available estimate which concerns fetal loss after late amniocentesis 15 or more completed gestational weeks indicates a 1 percentage point increase in the risk. most of these losses are miscarriages moderately strong scientific evidence. pregnant women prefer individual to group information. audio or video information appears to improve their knowledge and understanding somewhat more effectively than letters and brochures. however most studies reveal inadequacies when it comes to providing information to women prior to prenatal diagnosis. the women are not sufficiently knowledgeable particularly with respect to the purpose and the potential implications of the results to make a wellfounded decision about whether or not to undergo testing. it is especially difficult for them to understand that nuchal translucency measurement with ultrasound and an evaluation of markers is part of a probability assessment rather than a final diagnosis strong scientific evidence. most pregnant women want to obtain early information and prefer screening in the first trimester strong scientific evidence. greater knowledge does not make pregnant women more anxious. the information required to minimize their stress and anxiety levels should be communicated in the same way as that which is provided prior to other medical interventions. increased anxiety prior to prenatal diagnosis while waiting for the results or after obtaining notification of detected or of increased probability of abnormalities is a natural reaction on the part of the woman andor her partner strong scientific evidence,,,,,Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment
id_0005784;id_0005785,id_0005785,article,swedishcouncilonhealthtechnologyassessment,2007,sbu systematic review summaries,,,,conclusions the primary objective of the project was to systematically examine the scientific evidence for the benefits and risks of fortifying flour with folic acid. benefits refer to the possibility that the incidence of neural tube defects ntds is lower with fortification than without fortification. risks refer to the possibility that a higher intake of folic acid increases the likelihood of twin pregnancy. other possible effects of fortification were not included in the examination. the main conclusion of the swedish council on technology assessment in health care is that mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid cannot be unequivocally recommended based on the scientific evidence in this report.an overall assessment indicates that fortification reduces the incidence of ntds moderately strong scientific evidence. due to uncertainty about the extent to which pregnancies that are terminated due to diagnosed ntds are underreported in both sweden and countries from which the results of fortification are available promising how much ntds can decrease in sweden is not deemed reasonable.the results concerning the association between folic acid intake and the risk of twin pregnancy are conflicting contradictory scientific evidence. the results that have been presented on the effects of fortifying flour do not indicate that the incidence of twin births would increase. however data from randomised controlled trials suggest a possible increase. if so larger doses of folic acid would be involved than have been of interest for fortification so far. the results of a large prospective cohort study which administered the same dose as two of the controlled trials and controlled well for potential sources of error do not support the hypothesis that dietary supplements with folic acid increase the risk of twin birth. the results of five observational studies four of which were based on selfreported intake of tablets containing folic acid and one of which concerned dietary intake of folate are conflicting. folates play an important role in cell production and may theoretically be expected to stimulate growth of existing tumours as well as possibly accelerate the transformation of precancerous stages to active malignancy. some animal experimental studies support that hypothesis and a few studies suggest an association between high folate levels and colorectal cancer. addressing such questions was not the objective of a systematic literature search for this report. mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid 140160 micrograms per 100 grams in sweden would probably reduce the number of ntd pregnancies. however it is not possible to determine with any degree of assurance how large the decrease would be. the main reason is uncertainty about the number of pregnancies in sweden and elsewhere that are currently terminated with the indication of ntds. assuming for the sake of argument that the reduction would be 25 foetuses with ntds would decrease from 100 to 75 late terminations would decrease from 80 to 56 and newborns with ntds would decrease from 2025 to 1520,,,,,Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment

has traditionally been one of apprenticeship where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. this is time consuming costly and of variable effectiveness. training using a box model physical simulator either a video box or a mirrored box is an option to supplement standard training. however the impact of this modality on trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. objectives to compare the benefits and harms of box model training versus no training another box model animal model or cadaveric model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience. search methods we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials central medline embase and science citation index expanded to may 2013. selection criteria we included all randomised clinical trials comparing box model trainers versus no training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience. we also included trials comparing different methods of box model training. data collection and analysis two authors independently identified trials and collected data. we analysed the data with both the fixedeffect and the

possible. main results twentyfive trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review. all but one trial were at high risk of bias. overall 16 trials 464 participants provided data for metaanalysis of box training 248 participants versus no supplementary training 216 participants. all the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. overall 14 trials 382 participants provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training. there were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training. box model training versus no training the metaanalysis showed that the time taken for task completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group 8 trials 249 participants smd 0.48 seconds 95 ci 0.74 to 0.22. compared with the control group the box trainer group also had lower error score 3 trials 69 participants smd 0.69 95 ci 1.21 to 0.17 better accuracy score 3 trials 73 participants smd 0.67 95 ci 0.18 to 1.17 and better composite performance scores smd 0.65 95 ci 0.42 to 0.88. three trials reported movement distance but could not be metaanalysed as they were not in a format for metaanalysis. there was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials. none of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training error in movements and trainee satisfaction. different methods of box training one trial 36 participants found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer smd 3.79 seconds 95 ci 4.92 to 2.65. there was no significant difference in the time taken to complete the task in the remaining three comparisons reverse alignment versus forward alignment box training box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills and single incision versus multiport box model training. there were no significant differences in the error score between the two groups in any of the comparisons box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills single incision versus multiport box model training zmaze box training versus umaze box training. the only trial that reported accuracy score found significantly higher accuracy score with zmaze box training than umaze box training 1 trial 16 participants smd 1.55 95 ci 0.39 to 2.71. one trial 36 participants found significantly higher composite score with simple cardboard box trainer compared with conventional pelvic trainer smd 0.87 95 ci 0.19 to 1.56. another trial 22 participants found significantly higher composite score with reverse alignment compared with forward alignment box training smd 1.82 95 ci 0.79 to 2.84. there were no significant differences in the composite score between the intervention and control groups in any of the remaining comparisons. none of the secondary outcomes were adequately reported in the trials. authors conclusions the results of this review are threatened by both risks of systematic errors bias and risks of random errors play of chance. laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with no training in trainees with no previous laparoscopic experience. the impacts of this decreased time on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs are unknown. there appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training. further welldesigned trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary. such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients,101002/14651858cd010479pub2,,,coch data syst rev,Nagendran M.Toon C.

uncertainty regarding the effects of a mediterraneanstyle diet on clinical endpoints and cvd risk factors for both primary and secondary prevention. the quality of evidence for the modest benefits on cvd risk factors in primary prevention is low or moderate with a small number of studies reporting minimal harms. there is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention. the ongoing studies may

effects into low medium and high helminth endemicity areas did not demonstrate any pattern of effect. in a sensitivity analysis that only included trials with adequate allocation concealment we detected no significant effects for any primary outcomes.one million children were randomized in a deworming trial from india with mortality as the primary outcome. this was completed in 2005 but the authors have not published the results. authors conclusions screening children for intestinal helminths and then treating infected children appears promising but the evidence base is small. routine deworming drugs given to school children has been more extensively investigated and has not shown benefit on weight in most studies except for substantial weight changes in three trials conducted 15 years ago or more. two of these trials were carried out in the same high prevalence setting. for haemoglobin and cognition community deworming seems to have little or no effect and the evidence in relation to school attendance and school performance is generally poor with no obvious or consistent effect. our interpretation of this data is that it is probably misleading to justify contemporary deworming programmes based on evidence of consistent benefit on nutrition haemoglobin school attendance or school performance as there is simply insufficient reliable information to know whether this

school performance,,7,000371,the world health organization who recommends treating all school children at regular intervals with deworming drugs in areas where helminth infection is common. the who state this will improve nutritional status haemoglobin and cognition and thus will improve health intellect and school attendance. consequently it is claimed that school performance will improve child mortality will decline and economic productivity will increase. given the important health and societal benefits attributed to this intervention we sought to determine whether they are based on reliable evidence. objectives to summarize the effects of giving deworming drugs to children to treat soiltransmitted intestinal worms nematode geohelminths on weight haemoglobin and cognition and the evidence of impact on physical well being school attendance school performance and mortality. search methods in february 2012 we searched the cochrane infectious diseases group specialized register medline embase lilacs mrct and reference lists and registers of ongoing and completed trials. selection criteria we selected randomized controlled trials rcts and quasircts comparing deworming drugs for geohelminth worms with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less reporting on weight haemoglobin and formal test of intellectual development. in clusterrcts treating communities or schools we also sought data on school attendance school performance and mortality. we included trials that included health education with deworming. data collection and analysis at least two authors independently assessed the trials evaluated risk of bias and extracted data. continuous data were analysed using the mean difference md with 95 confidence intervals ci. where data were missing we contacted trial authors. we used grade to assess evidence quality and this is reflected in the wording we used high quality deworming improves.... moderate quality deworming probably improves... low quality deworming may improve.... and very low quality we dont know if deworming improves..... main results we identified 42 trials including eight cluster trials that met the inclusion criteria. excluding one trial where data are awaited the 41 trials include 65168 participants.for programmes that treat only children detected as infected by screening a single dose of deworming drugs probably increased weight 0.58 kg 95 ci 0.40 to 0.76 three trials 139 participants moderate quality evidence and may have increased haemoglobin 0.37 gdl 95 ci 0.1 to 0.64 two trials 108 participants low quality evidence but we do not know if there is an effect on cognitive functioning two trials very low quality evidence.for a single dose of deworming drugs given to all children in endemic areas there were mixed effects on weight with no effects evident in seven trials but large effects in two. overall our analysis indicated that we are uncertain whether there was an effect on weight nine trials 3058 participants very low quality evidence. for haemoglobin deworming made little or no difference 0.02 gdl 95 ci 0.05 to 0.09 four trials 1992 participants low quality evidence and we dont know if it improves cognition one trial very low quality evidence.for multiple doses of deworming drugs with follow up for up to one year given to all children in endemic areas we are uncertain if there is an effect on weight 0.06 kg 95 ci 0.17 to 0.30 seven trials 2460 participants very low quality evidence cognition three trials very low quality evidence or school attendance 4 higher attendance 95 ci 6 to 14 two trials 75 clusters and 143 individually randomized participants very low quality evidence. for haemoglobin the intervention may have little or no effect mean 0.01 gdl lower 95 ci 0.14 lower to 0.13 higher four trials 807 participants low quality evidence.for multiple doses of deworming drugs with follow up beyond one year given to all children in endemic areas there were five trials with weight measures. one clusterrct of 3712 children in a low prevalence area showed a large effect average gain of 0.98kg whilst the other four trials did not show an effect including a clusterrct of 27995 children in a moderate prevalence area. overall we are uncertain if there is an effect for weight five trials 302 clusters and 1045 individually randomized participants very low quality evidence. for other outcomes we are uncertain whether deworming affects height 0.26 cm 95ci 0.84 to 0.31 three trials 1219 participants haemoglobin 0.02 gdl 95ci 0.3 to 0.27 two trials 1365 participants cognition two trials or school attendance mean attendance 5 higher 95 ci 0.5 to 10.5 one trial 50 clusters.stratified analysis to seek subgroup effects into low medium and high helminth endemicity areas did not demonstrate any pattern of effect. we did not detect any significant effects for any primary outcomes in a sensitivity analysis only including trials with adequate allocation concealment.one million children were randomized in a deworming trial from india with mortality as the primary outcome. this was completed in 2005 but the authors have not published the results. authors conclusions screening children for intestinal helminths and then treating infected children appears promising but the evidence base is small. routine deworming drugs given to school children has been more extensively investigated and has not shown benefit on weight in most studies except for substantial weight changes in three trials conducted 15 years ago or more. two of these trials were carried out in the same high prevalence setting. for haemoglobin community deworming seems to have little or no effect and the evidence in relation to cognition school attendance and school performance is generally poor with no obvious or consistent effect. our interpretation of this data is that it is probably misleading to justify contemporary deworming programmes based on evidence of consistent benefit on nutrition haemoglobin school attendance or school performance as there is simply insufficient reliable information to know whether this is

varying success. as owcl tends to heal spontaneously it is necessary to justify the use of systemic and topical treatments. this is an update of a cochrane review first published in 2008. objectives to assess the effects of therapeutic interventions for the localised form of old world cutaneous leishmaniasis. search methods we updated our searches of the following databases to november 2016 the cochrane skin specialised register central medline embase and lilacs. we also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials rcts. we wrote to national programme managers general coordinators directors clinicians whoemro regional officers of endemic countries pharmaceutical companies tropical medicine centres and authors of relevant papers for further information about relevant unpublished and ongoing trials. we undertook a separate search for adverse effects of interventions for old world cutaneous leishmaniasis in september 2015 using medline. selection criteria randomised controlled trials of either single or combination treatments in immunocompetent people with owcl confirmed by smear histology culture or polymerase chain reaction. the comparators were either no treatment placebovehicle andor another active compound. data collection and analysis two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias and extracted data. we only synthesised data when we were able to identify at least two studies investigating similar treatments and reporting data amenable to pooling. we also recorded data about adverse effects from the corresponding search. main results we included 89 studies of which 40 were new to this update in 10583 people with owcl. the studies included were conducted mainly in the far or middle east at regional hospitals local healthcare clinics and skin disease research centres. women accounted for 41.5 of the participants range 23 to 80. the overall mean age of participants was 25 years range 12 to 56. most studies lasted between two to six months with the longest lasting two years average duration was four months. most studies were at unclear or high risk for most bias domains. a lack of blinding and reporting bias were present in almost 40 of studies. two trials were at low risk of bias for all domains. trials reported the causative species poorly.here we provide results for the two main comparisons identified itraconazole 200 mg for six to eight weeks versus placebo and paromomycin ointment 15 plus 10 urea twice daily for 14 days versus vehicle.in the comparison of oral itraconazole versus placebo at 2.5 months follow up 85125 participants in the itraconazole group achieved complete cure compared to 54119 in the placebo group rr 3.70 95 ci 0.35 to 38.99 3 studies 244 participants. in one study microbiological or histopathological cure of skin lesions only occurred in the itraconazole group after a mean followup of 2.5 months rr 17.00 95 ci 0.47 to 612.21 20 participants. however although the analyses favour oral itraconazole for these outcomes we cannot be confident in the results due to the very low certainty evidence. more side effects of mild abdominal pain and nausea rr 2.36 95 ci 0.74 to 7.47 3 studies 204 participants and mild abnormal liver function rr 3.08 95 ci 0.53 to 17.98 3 studies 84 participants occurred in the itraconazole group as well as reports of headaches and dizziness compared with the placebo group but again we rated the certainty of evidence as very low so are unsure of the results.when comparing paromomycin with vehicle there was no difference in the number of participants who achieved complete cure rr of 1.00 95 ci 0.86 1.17 383 participants 2 studies and microbiological or histopathological cure of skin lesions after a mean followup of 2.5 months rr 1.03 ci 0.88 to 1.20 383 participants 2 studies but the paromomycin group had more skinlocal reactions such as inflammation vesiculation pain redness or itch rr 1.42 95 ci 0.67 to 3.01 4 studies 713 participants. for all of these outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low meaning we are unsure about these results.trial authors did not report the percentage of lesions cured after the end of treatment or speed of healing for either of these key comparisons. authors conclusions there was very lowcertainty evidence to support the effectiveness of itraconazole and paromomycin ointment for owcl in terms of cure i.e. microbiological or histopathological cure and percentage of participants completely cured. both of these interventions incited more adverse effects which were mild in nature than their comparisons but we could draw no conclusions regarding safety due to the very low certainty of the evidence for this outcome.we downgraded the key outcomes in these two comparisons due to high risk of bias inconsistency between the results and imprecision. there is a need for large welldesigned international studies that evaluate longterm effects of current therapies and enable a reliable conclusion about treatments. future trials should specify the species of leishmaniasis trials on types caused by leishmania infantum l aethiopica andl donovani are lacking. research into the effects of treating women of childbearing age children people with comorbid conditions and those who are immunocompromised would also be helpful.it was difficult to evaluate the overall efficacy of any of the numerous treatments due to the variable treatment regimens examined and because rcts evaluated different leishmania species and took place in different geographical areas. some outcomes we looked for but did not find were degree of functional and aesthetic impairment change in ability to detect leishmania quality of life and emergence of resistance. there were only limited data on prevention of scarring,101002/14651858cd005067pub5,,,coch data syst

to assess the effects of therapeutic interventions for the localised form of old world cutaneous leishmaniasis. search methods we updated our searches of the following databases to november 2016 the cochrane skin specialised register central medline embase and lilacs. we also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials rcts. we wrote to national programme managers general coordinators directors clinicians whoemro regional officers of endemic countries pharmaceutical companies tropical medicine centres and authors of relevant papers for further information about relevant unpublished and ongoing trials. we undertook a separate search for adverse effects of interventions for old world cutaneous leishmaniasis in september 2015 using medline. selection criteria randomised controlled trials of either single or combination treatments in immunocompetent people with owcl confirmed by smear histology culture or polymerase chain reaction. the comparators were either no treatment placebovehicle andor another active compound. data collection and analysis two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias and extracted data. we only synthesised data when we were able to identify at least two studies investigating similar treatments and reporting data amenable to pooling. we also recorded data about adverse effects from the corresponding search. main results we included 89 studies of which 40 were new to this update in 10583 people with owcl. the studies included were conducted mainly in the far or middle east at regional hospitals local healthcare clinics and skin disease research centres. women accounted for 41.5 of the participants range 23 to 80. the overall mean age of participants was 25 years range 12 to 56. most studies lasted between two to six months with the longest lasting two years average duration was four months. most studies were at unclear or high risk for most bias domains. a lack of blinding and reporting bias were present in almost 40 of studies. two trials were at low risk of bias for all domains. trials reported the causative species poorly.here we provide results for the two main comparisons identified itraconazole 200 mg for six to eight weeks versus placebo and paromomycin ointment 15 plus 10 urea twice daily for 14 days versus vehicle.in the comparison of oral itraconazole versus placebo at 2.5 months follow up 85125 participants in the itraconazole group achieved complete cure compared to 54119 in the placebo group rr 3.70 95 ci 0.35 to 38.99 3 studies 244 participants. in one study microbiological or histopathological cure of skin lesions only occurred in the itraconazole group after a mean followup of 2.5 months rr 17.00 95 ci 0.47 to 612.21 20 participants. however although the analyses favour oral itraconazole for these outcomes we cannot be confident in the results due to the very low certainty evidence. more side effects of mild abdominal pain and nausea rr 2.36 95 ci 0.74 to 7.47 3 studies 204 participants and mild abnormal liver function rr 3.08 95 ci 0.53 to 17.98 3 studies 84 participants occurred in the itraconazole group as well as reports of headaches and dizziness compared with the placebo group but again we rated the certainty of evidence as very low so are unsure of the results.when comparing paromomycin with vehicle there was no difference in the number of participants who achieved complete cure rr of 1.00 95 ci 0.86 1.17 383 participants 2 studies and microbiological or histopathological cure of skin lesions after a mean followup of 2.5 months rr 1.03 ci 0.88 to 1.20 383 participants 2 studies but the paromomycin group had more skinlocal reactions such as inflammation vesiculation pain redness or itch rr 1.42 95 ci 0.67 to 3.01 4 studies 713 participants. for all of these outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low meaning we are unsure about these results.trial authors did not report the percentage of lesions cured after the end of treatment or speed of healing for either of these key comparisons. authors conclusions there was very lowcertainty evidence to support the effectiveness of itraconazole and paromomycin ointment for owcl in terms of cure i.e. microbiological or histopathological cure and percentage of participants completely cured. both of these interventions incited more adverse effects which were mild in nature than their comparisons but we could draw no conclusions regarding safety due to the very low certainty of the evidence for this outcome.we downgraded the key outcomes in these two comparisons due to high risk of bias inconsistency between the results and imprecision. there is a need for large welldesigned international studies that evaluate longterm effects of current therapies and enable a reliable conclusion about treatments. future trials should specify the species of leishmaniasis trials on types caused by leishmania infantum l aethiopica andl donovani are lacking. research into the effects of treating women of childbearing age children people with comorbid conditions and those who are immunocompromised would also be helpful.it was difficult to evaluate the overall efficacy of any of the numerous treatments due to the variable treatment regimens examined and because rcts evaluated different leishmania species and took place in different geographical areas. some outcomes we looked for but did not find were degree of functional and aesthetic impairment change in ability to detect leishmania quality of life and emergence of resistance. there were only limited data on prevention of scarring,101002/14651858cd005067pub4,,,coch data syst

training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. this is time consuming costly and of variable effectiveness. training using a box model physical simulator either a video box or a mirrored box is an option to supplement standard training. however the impact of this modality on trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. objectives to compare the benefits and harms of box model training versus no training another box model animal model or cadaveric model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience. search methods we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials central medline embase and science citation index expanded to may 2013. selection criteria we included all randomised clinical trials comparing box model trainers versus no training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience. we also included trials comparing different methods of box model training. data collection and analysis two authors independently identified trials and collected data. we analysed the data with both the fixedeffect and the randomeffects models using review manager for analysis. for each outcome we calculated the standardised mean difference smd with 95 confidence intervals ci based on intentiontotreat analysis whenever possible. main results twentyfive trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review. all but one trial were at high risk of bias. overall 16 trials 464 participants provided data for metaanalysis of box training 248 participants versus no supplementary training 216 participants. all the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. overall 14 trials 382 participants provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training. there were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training. box model training versus no training the metaanalysis showed that the time taken for task completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group 8 trials 249 participants smd 0.48 seconds 95 ci 0.74 to 0.22. compared with the control group the box trainer group also had lower error score 3 trials 69 participants smd 0.69 95 ci 1.21 to 0.17 better accuracy score 3 trials 73 participants smd 0.67 95 ci 0.18 to 1.17 and better composite performance scores smd 0.65 95 ci 0.42 to 0.88. three trials reported movement distance but could not be metaanalysed as they were not in a format for metaanalysis. there was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials. none of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training error in movements and trainee satisfaction. different methods of box training one trial 36 participants found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer smd 3.79 seconds 95 ci 4.92 to 2.65. there was no significant difference in the time taken to complete the task in the remaining three comparisons reverse alignment versus forward alignment box training box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills and single incision versus multiport box model training. there were no significant differences in the error score between the two groups in any of the comparisons box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills single incision versus multiport box model training zmaze box training versus umaze box training. the only trial that reported accuracy score found significantly higher accuracy score with zmaze box training than umaze box training 1 trial 16 participants smd 1.55 95 ci 0.39 to 2.71. one trial 36 participants found significantly higher composite score with simple cardboard box trainer compared with conventional pelvic trainer smd 0.87 95 ci 0.19 to 1.56. another trial 22 participants found significantly higher composite score with reverse alignment compared with forward alignment box training smd 1.82 95 ci 0.79 to 2.84. there were no significant differences in the composite score between the intervention and control groups in any of the remaining comparisons. none of the secondary outcomes were adequately reported in the trials. authors conclusions the results of this review are threatened by both risks of systematic errors bias and risks of random errors play of chance. laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with no training in trainees with no previous laparoscopic experience. the impacts of this decreased time on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs are unknown. there appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training. further welldesigned trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary. such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patient,101002/14651858cd010479pub2,,,coch data syst rev,Nagendran M.Toon C.
